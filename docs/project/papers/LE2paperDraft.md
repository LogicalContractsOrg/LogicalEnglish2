## 1. Introduction

Logical English (LE) is a controlled natural language designed so that
domain experts can write executable rules that read like ordinary English
yet have a precise logical reading [1, 2]. The motivation is to reduce
the distance between informal legal or business prose and the formal
artefacts that machines reason with: rather than encoding a regulation in
a programming language and then verifying that the encoding is faithful
to the text, one would prefer the regulation itself to serve as the
program. LE has been applied to tax law, contracts, citizenship rules,
financial agreements, and, more recently, to a domain-specific dialect
for insurance contracts [3]; the same line of work has been used to
discuss the limits and opportunities of LLM-assisted authoring of
financial contracts [5], and has also been proposed as a vehicle for
teaching logic and computational thinking to school-age learners [2].

A program in LE consists of *templates* — natural-language patterns with
typed argument slots, e.g. `*a person* is the father of *another
person*` — used to express *facts*, *rules* (`Head if Body`), *queries*
and *scenarios* of test facts. Reasoning produces both answers and
*justification trees* phrased in the same controlled English, allowing
users to inspect how a conclusion was reached. The language has remained
close to a stable core since [1]: templates with `*…*` slots,
conjunction, disjunction, `unless`, classical and conditional negation,
universal quantification (`for all cases in which … it is the case that
…`), aggregates (`sum`, `count`, `min`, `max`, `average`), an ontology
section for `is_a` taxonomies, and the use of `that` to embed sentences
as meta-arguments.

This note compares two implementations of that language. The first,
referred to here as **LE1**, is the original implementation associated
with [1, 2] and developed at Imperial College and partner organisations.
The second, **LE2**, is a clean reimplementation undertaken by the same
working group, with the goal of making LE easier to use, easier to
deploy, and easier to embed in modern toolchains. The two systems
interpret essentially the same language — programs written for one will
typically port to the other with small surface adjustments — but they
differ substantially in scope, tooling, and intended audience.

## 2. Logical English (LE1)

LE1 was conceived as a research artefact whose primary value was to
demonstrate that a controlled natural language coupled with logic
programming can faithfully represent legal and contractual reasoning. Its
design emphasises **breadth**: a wide range of language constructs,
several reasoning back-ends, and integration with an existing notebook
environment for logic programming.

**Form of delivery.** LE1 is distributed as a SWI-Prolog package intended
to be loaded into SWISH, the web-based Prolog notebook server. A LE
document is typically embedded as a string inside a Prolog source file
and translated on demand by predicates such as `answer/1` or
`answer X with scenario Y`. Users interact with the system either through
a SWISH notebook or through an external Visual Studio Code extension that
communicates with a SWISH server.

**Reasoning back-ends.** LE1 can target three back-ends from the same LE
source: pure Prolog, *TaxLog* (a Prolog dialect with explanation
facilities, originally developed for tax-law applications), and
*s(CASP)*, a constraint-based ASP system that supports classical
negation, abducibles and HTML-rendered justifications. The choice of
back-end is determined by a `the target language is …` declaration. This
plurality made LE1 a useful platform for investigating which form of
non-monotonic reasoning is best suited to a given legal artefact.

**Language scope.** Beyond the stable core listed in §1, LE1 supports
several constructs that reflect its experimental character: multilingual
front-ends for English, French, Italian and Spanish; *event* and *fluent*
sections for temporal reasoning in the style of the Event Calculus; the
form `*X* is a collection of … where …` for set-comprehension; multiple
combined knowledge bases with simple inheritance; rule names; and
prototype mechanisms for deontic operators and rule priorities. The
handbook and the `le_syntax.md` document describe these features in
detail; several of them are flagged as experimental or "currently being
tested".

**Application portfolio.** The repository ships an example library of
contracts and statutes encoded in LE — the small business restructure
rollover, the net-asset-value test for capital gains, the ISDA Master
Agreement, the OECD model tax convention, criminal-justice rules, an
escrow blockchain agreement, and Italian citizenship law — most of which
appear, in whole or in part, in the published literature [1, 2].
**InsurLE** [3] is a more recent extension developed in the same family:
a domain-specific controlled natural language for insurance contracts
that adds an insurance ontology, restrictive relative clauses, and a
rule-and-exception structure that mirrors the form in which insurers
currently write policy documents. The aim is for the contract text and
the machine-readable representation to coincide, eliminating the
verification gap that arises when a separate codification is maintained
alongside the prose.

**Style.** LE1 grew incrementally over several years. Its strength is
that almost every language idea explored in the LE research line has
been prototyped at least once; the corresponding cost is a sizeable code
base whose features have accumulated organically and whose deployment
story (SWISH plus external clients) is oriented toward researchers and
pilot users rather than general developers.

## 3. Logical English 2

LE2 is a redesign and full reimplementation of the same language family.
Its goal is not to extend LE — the language is, if anything, slightly
narrower — but to consolidate the parts of LE that are robustly useful
into a single coherent system that can be installed, deployed, and
extended outside a SWISH environment.

### 3.1 Language

LE2 carries forward the stable LE core: templates and facts, `if`-rules,
`and`/`or`/`unless`/negation, universal quantification, aggregates,
ontologies, scenarios, queries, the `that` meta-argument convention, and
fluents/events for temporal modelling. Three smaller language changes are
worth noting.

First, LE2 treats *testing* as a first-class concept. A scenario may
declare expected answers (`<query> expects answers ["…"].`); these are
parsed as part of the document and exercised by a built-in test runner.
A LE file is, in effect, both program and test suite — a property
intended to support continuous verification as the rules evolve.

Second, LE2 exposes a small **introspection API** as named system
predicates: the active knowledge base, the source-level identifier of the
current rule, the type taxonomy, hierarchical designators for numbered
rules of the form `1.1.a`, and structured records for parsing issues and
expected answers. This makes LE programs themselves describable from
within LE, which can be useful for explanation, for legal
cross-referencing, and for tools built on top of the language.

Third, LE2 deliberately drops or postpones some of LE1's experimental
constructs. The current implementation targets only Prolog (s(CASP) and
TaxLog back-ends, and the multilingual front-ends, are not present); the
`is a collection of … where …` form, deontic prototypes and
rule-priority hierarchies are likewise absent from this iteration. These
are roadmap items rather than rejected ideas, and the reimplementation
includes explicit extension points (multifile hooks at the parsing,
second-pass and reasoning levels) so that they — or proprietary
additions — can be re-introduced without forking the core.

### 3.2 Tooling

A salient difference between the two systems is the **integrated
development environment** included with LE2. Rather than relying on
SWISH or an external editor, LE2 ships a browser-based IDE with
template-aware syntax highlighting (so user-defined template words are
not confused with language keywords), live error reporting against a
structured diagnostic model, code folding by section and rule,
completion of templates, hover inspection, and an integrated query and
explanation panel.

The IDE is supplemented by an in-document chat-style **LE Assistant**
that can drive an LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic or Google models, configured
locally by the user) to explain, refactor, or generate LE code. The
assistant can both produce new code from a natural-language description
(Figure 1) and apply targeted edits to the document under user
supervision (Figure 2). This kind of LLM-assisted authoring of legal and
financial rules — and its limits — has been the subject of independent
discussion in the financial-contracts literature [5].

natural-language brief.](paperImages/assistant-generation.png)

![Figure 2. The LE Assistant applying targeted edits to an existing
document.](paperImages/assistant-editing.png)

LE2 also speaks two protocols that did not have a usable form during
LE1's main development. A **Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)** server is
under development, with the intention that any DAP-compliant client (VS
Code, JetBrains IDEs and others) will be able to step through an LE
proof, set breakpoints, and inspect the chain of ancestor goals; the
underlying tracer is operational, while the client-facing surface is
still being stabilised. LE2 also implements the **Model Context Protocol
(MCP)**, an emerging standard for tool-using LLMs, which allows agents
to load LE documents, run queries and verify rules through a typed
interface. Together these protocols are intended to make LE invokable
by external software — IDEs and tool-using language models alike —
without bespoke glue.

In addition to the textual editor, LE2 generates a **graph view** of the
loaded knowledge base (Figure 3): predicates appear as nodes and rule
dependencies as edges, providing a structural overview of larger
documents and a navigational complement to the source view.

their rule-level dependencies.](paperImages/graph.png)

### 3.3 Reasoning and verification

LE2's reasoner is a fresh meta-interpreter rather than a layer over an
existing logic-programming substrate. The most user-visible consequence
is that explanations are pervasive: every successful proof yields a
natural-language justification tree, and every *failed* query yields a
failure tree explaining why each candidate path did not succeed.
Justification nodes carry source-range information, so the IDE can
render explanations as a navigable structure: clicking a step in the
tree selects the corresponding rule or clause in the editor (Figure 4).
Each loaded document is associated with an isolated reasoning session,
so concurrent users — and concurrent scenarios within a session — do
not interfere with one another's facts.

![Figure 4. An interactive explanation tree in the LE2 IDE; clicking a
node selects the corresponding source range.](paperImages/explanations.png)

A separate **verifier** runs at every load and produces a structured
list of issues: missing templates, undefined predicates, untested
predicates, rules with no variables, redefined system templates, and
failed expectations. Each issue carries a description, a suggested fix
and a source range, so the editor can render diagnostics inline and
offer quick-fixes. LE1 reports diagnostics as text; LE2 records them as
structured data, which is exposed to clients over the API.

### 3.4 Deployment

LE1 is run as a SWISH plug-in or via small example servers bundled with
the repository. LE2 is a self-contained HTTP service: a single command
brings up a JSON-over-HTTP API together with the editor as a web
application, and a Docker image packages both. A hosted demonstration
runs at `le2.logicalcontracts.com`. The intent is that an organisation
adopting LE for an actual workflow should not need to learn SWISH
first.

### 3.5 What LE2 inherits and what it changes, in summary

LE2 keeps:

- the language and semantics of LE's stable core, sufficient to express
  the bulk of the LE1 example portfolio;
- the principle that the source text and the executable artefact should
  coincide;
- the use of justification trees rendered in the same controlled English
  as the rules.

LE2 changes:

- **Surface**: a dedicated browser IDE replaces SWISH and external
  extensions; explanations and diagnostics are presented as interactive
  structures rather than as text output.
- **Engineering**: a smaller, more modular code base built around a
  source-tracking pipeline that retains character offsets from token to
  proof tree.
- **Integration**: web, MCP and DAP endpoints make LE usable from IDEs
  and from LLM-based agents without bespoke glue.
- **Process**: tests are part of the language, the verifier is part of
  the loop, and extension points are part of the architecture.

LE2 narrows:

- to a single Prolog back-end and a single (English) front-end, with
  s(CASP), TaxLog, multilingual support and several experimental
  constructs deferred to future work.

## 4. Conclusion

LE1 and LE2 are best understood as two phases of the same project. LE1
established the language and the case for it [1, 2], explored its reach
through experimental constructs and multiple back-ends, and demonstrated
domain-specific viability through extensions such as InsurLE [3]. LE2
packages a consolidated core of that work as a self-contained
development environment, with verification, debugging and LLM
integration included. The two systems are complementary: LE1 remains the
reference for the wider design space LE has explored, while LE2 is
intended as a more accessible entry point for new users and new
applications, including the LLM-assisted authoring scenarios discussed
in [5].
