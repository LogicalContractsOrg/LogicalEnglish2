# Vibe coding the new LE

Unlike LE1, written by carbon units Jacinto, Bob and Miguel, LE2 was mostly vibe coded via silicon with https://opencode.ai and gemini-3-flash-preview. Following are the main prompts used, for historical record. See also AGENTS.md, e.g. "Opencode's CLAUDE.md". 

## Initial prompt
You are an expert in Logical English (LE), a constrained natural language mapping to PROLOG. It is described in @docs/le_syntax.md. There are examples in @examples/moreExamples - all files with extension .le

Write me a Definite Clause Grammar into a single file le_grammar.pl, that is able to parse any of the given LE examples.
You must call the existing predicate tokenize(String,Tokens) in @tokenizer.pl, which returns these token terms:

1. Structural & Whitespace Tokens

indent(Count, Location): Generated specifically at the start of a new line. Count represents the number of leading spaces.
punctuation(Atom, Location): 

2. Literal & Value Tokens

word(Atom, Location): A sequence starting with an alphabetic character followed by alphanumeric characters.
number(Integer, Location): A sequence of one or more digits converted into a Prolog number.
date(date(Y, M, D), Location): Specifically matches the format YYYY-MM-DD. 

3. String & Quote Tokens

quoteString(String, Location): Content wrapped in single quotes ('...').
doubleQuoteString(String, Location): Content wrapped in double quotes ("...").

4. Comment Tokens

line_comment(String, Location): Text appearing after a % symbol until the end of the line.
multi_comment(String, Location): 


To execute SWI-PROLOG  use the shell command /Applications/SWI-Prolog10.0.0-1.app/Contents/MacOS/swipl

## Next
Looks good. Now take the current le_grammar.pl and start adding semantics. First, in the rule for section(predicates(Ts)) , instead of Ts return a list of dict(FunctorArgs,NamesTypes,WordsAndVars), by calling a new predicate templatesToDicts/2 that you need to write. 
For example for a template 

    *an asset* was received for an injury at *a place* of *a taxpayer*. 

the dict term should be

    dict([was_received_for_an_injury_at_of,A,B,C], [asset-asset,place-place,taxpayer-taxpayer], [A,was,received,for,an,injury,at,B,of,C])

Notice how each template originates a precise predicate functor name, made of the template words concatenated with underscores.

## Next...
There is a confusion in the code, in that templates in declarations contain variables delimited by *, but template instances in rules do not use the *. So you should create a new rule for template, call it from  templates//1 ; it should call template_part which btw should not cover of date(_), list(_), expr(_) and punct(_) which can not be used in template declarations. Then template_instance should continue to be called from rule as now

## literals

We want to transform rules into Prolog clauses. So we need to refine the rule bodies to contain a term with any LE logical connectives, for example and(LiteralA,or(LiteralB,LiteralB)), as well as the literals (template instances).  So we need a "second pass", a new predicate called at the end of parse_le/2, already with the benefit of the templates being known, which takes the Doc AST and processes its kb list of rules into a list of clauses:
- Each rule head must match a template in the templates list; the PROLOG clause head will be dict/3's first argument
- Each rule body may have a tree logic structure as per the LE language, with expressions and literals in the leaves; each literal must match a template too

## fixing it
The parsing is not quite well yet. For example in citizenship.le the first rule...

a person acquires British citizenship on a date
if the person is born in the UK on the date
and the date is after commencement
and an other person is the mother of the person
    or the other person is the father of the person
and the other person is a British citizen on the date
    or the other person is settled in the UK on the date.

... is not being parsed correctly; instead of:

clause([acquires_British_citizenship_on,'a person','a date'],
		  or([is_born_in_on,'the person','the UK','the date'],
		     or([is_after_commencement,'the date'],
			or([is_the_mother_of,'an other person','the person'],
			   or([is_the_father_of,'the other person','the person'],
			      or([is_a_British_citizen_on,'the other person','the date'],[is_settled_in_the_UK_on,'the other person','the date']))))))

... it should parse instead to:

clause([acquires_British_citizenship_on,'a person','a date'],
		  and([is_born_in_on,'the person','the UK','the date'],
		     and([is_after_commencement,'the date'],
		        and(
                    or([is_the_mother_of,'an other person','the person'], [is_the_father_of,'the other person','the person']),
			      and(
                    or([is_a_British_citizen_on,'the other person','the date'],[is_settled_in_the_UK_on,'the other person','the date']))
                    ))))

There is a second problem, in the second rule:

a person is the father of an other person
    if a third person says 
    that the person is the father of the other person
    and the third person is qualified to determine fatherhood.

Its parse is wrong: 

	   clause([is_the_father_of,'a person','an other person'],
		  and(and(unknown_template([word(a),word(third),word(person),word(says)]),[is_the_father_of,'that the person','the other person']),
		      [is_qualified_to_determine_fatherhood,'the third person'])),

That unknoown_template is incorrect: "a third person" means just "a person"; second, third, etc. are auxiliaries just to allow different variables of the same type to be used. 

## more fixes
Better but not correct yet. For example in payg.le the first rule...

the estimated tax for an entity for a year is an amount ET
    if the estimated annual net tax payable for the entity for the year is ET
        and ET >= 0 
    or ET = 0
    	and it is not the case that
       		the estimated annual net tax payable for the entity for the year is an X.

...is not being parsed correctly; instead of:

clause([the_estimated_tax_for_for_is,'an entity','a year','an amount ET'],
		  and([the_estimated_annual_net_tax_payable_for_for_is,'the entity','the year','ET'],
		      or(unknown_tokens([word('ET',loc(5174,5176)),punct(>,loc(5177,5178)),punct(=,loc(5178,5179)),number(0,loc(5180,5181))]),
			 and(unknown_tokens([word('ET',loc(5190,5192)),punct(=,loc(5193,5194)),number(0,loc(5195,5196))]),
			     not([the_estimated_annual_net_tax_payable_for_for_is,'the entity','the year','an X'])))))

...it should parse instead to:

clause([the_estimated_tax_for_for_is,'an entity','a year','an amount ET'],
		  or( 
            and(
                [the_estimated_annual_net_tax_payable_for_for_is,'the entity','the year','ET'],
                '>='(ET,0) ),
			and(
                '='(ET,0),
			     not([the_estimated_annual_net_tax_payable_for_for_is,'the entity','the year','an X']))
            ))

## is_a
Much better, but the ontology clauses should use instead the is_a/2 predicate. 
Also, you should recognize Prolog's is/2, so for example payg.le's third rule ...

the applicable tax rate for an entity on a year is a number ATR
    if         the entity is under the aggregated turnover threshold in the year 
            or the entity is a base rate entity
        and ATR is 0.25
    or      ATR is 0.30
    	and it is not the case that
    		the entity is under the aggregated turnover threshold in the year
        and it is not the case that
        	the entity is a base rate entity.


should NOT parse to the following...:

	   clause(applicable_tax_rate_for_an_entity_on_a_year is number_ATR,
		  or([is_under_the_aggregated_turnover_threshold_in,entity,year],
		     or([is_a_base_rate_entity,entity],
			or(unknown_tokens([word('ATR',loc(6136,6139)),word(is,loc(6140,6142)),number(0,loc(6143,6144)),punctuation('.',loc(6144,6145)),number(25,loc(6145,6147))]),
			   or(unknown_tokens([word('ATR',loc(6160,6163)),word(is,loc(6164,6166)),number(0,loc(6167,6168)),punctuation('.',loc(6168,6169)),number(30,loc(6169,6171))]),
			      or(not([is_under_the_aggregated_turnover_threshold_in,entity,year]),not([is_a_base_rate_entity,entity])))))))

...but instead to:

	   clause(applicable_tax_rate_for_an_entity_on_a_year is number_ATR, or(
		  and(
            or(
                [is_under_the_aggregated_turnover_threshold_in,entity,year],
                [is_a_base_rate_entity,entity]
            ),
			is(ATR,0.25)
          ),
          and(
            is(ATR,0.30),
            and( not([is_under_the_aggregated_turnover_threshold_in,entity,year]),
                and(not([is_a_base_rate_entity,entity]))))))

## sums
Better, now we need to support aggregates properly. In rule

the year-to-date instalment adjustment for an entity E for an income year is an amount V
    if E is the taxpayer
    and the current quarter is a quarter C
    and the income year is a year under consideration
    and a number IR is the sum of each amount such that
            the amount with an ID was reported as an instalment on a quarter X of the income year
            and X is previous to C
    and a number IVC is the sum of each number such that
            the number with an other ID was reported as a variation on a quarter Y of the income year
            and Y is previous to C
    and V = IR - IVC.

... a subgoal such as ```a number IR is the sum of each amount such that INDENTED_GOAL``` needs to be parsed into something like:

    sum([each, amount], INDENTED_GOAL, [a number, IR])

## fixing sums

The fragment:

a number IR is the sum of each amount such that
            the amount with an ID was reported as an instalment on a quarter X of the income year
            and X is previous to C

...is being parsed into

sum([each,_],and([with_was_reported_as_an_instalment_on_of,amount,'an ID',quarter_X,income_year],[is_previous_to,'X','C']),[a,number,'IR']))

You're losing the aggregated variable; the forst argument needs to be [each,amount]

Also the following is failing to parse:

a number IVC is the sum of each number such that
            the number with an other ID was reported as a variation on a quarter Y of the income year
            and Y is previous to C

"the number with an other ID was reported as a variation on a quarter Y of the income year" is being parsed as unknown_tokens(..)

## simplify ontology and scenarios
In the ontology parse each fact as is_a(Type,SuperType) fact or clause

In scenarios and queries, instead of terms clause(Literal,true) keep simply Literal.

In scenarios, in general facts have no variables. For example "John is born in the UK on 2021-10-09" should be is_born_in_on('John',[the,'UK'],date(2021,10,09)); we can keep the date representation provided by out tokenizer.

## Error reporting
Let's add syntax error reporting, so we have a new last argument: parse_le(String, doc(NewSections), Issues), where Issues will be a list of error(Message,CharPosition); future versions may add warning(...) too. A normal parsing will return an empty Issues list. If errors exist, try keeping as much of the parsed doc as possible.
Also, any unknown_tokens(Tokens) in the parse result should be reported as errors too

To test this start by building variants of two examples: payg.le and citizenship.le, by introducing a few syntactic errors in each.

For the implementation, consider these optional suggestions: 
- CharPositions are in the tokens being parsed
- remainder(Tokens)//1 which returns the tokens not yet parsed; ans
- asserting errors, so that multiple errors can be noted in  thread_local temporary facts and collected at the end of the parse to include in the Issues list

  ---

There is a new bug:
?- test_all.
Parsing examples/moreExamples/1_cgt_assets_and_exemptions_3.le... 
ERROR: Type error: `text' expected, found `date(2015,10,24)' (a compound)
ERROR: In:
ERROR:   [72] atomic_list_concat([before,...],'_',_157872)
ERROR:   [69] le_grammar:extract_value_from_parts([word(before,...),...],_157916,[date-_157956,...|...],_157920,[dict(...,...,...),...|...],true,true) at /Users/mc/git/LogicalEnglish2/le_grammar.pl:547
ERROR:   [68] le_grammar:match_instance_to_template([word(before,...),...],[_158044],[date-_158058,...|...],_158018,[dict(...,...,...),...|...],true) at /Users/mc/git/LogicalEnglish2/le_grammar.p

## More clean up
The third argument of dict(..) should have simply the atoms and variable, not word(_) terms
Lists of atoms in ontology fact arguments should be concatenated into single atoms, e.g. [quarter,1] becoming quarter1

In payg.le the rule:

the year-to-date fraction for a quarter Q is a number F
    if Q is quarter 1 
        and F is 0.25
    or Q is quarter 2 
        and F is 0.5
    or Q is quarter 3 
        and F is 0.75
    or Q is quarter 4 
        and F is 1.0.

is not being parsed correctly: the head is resulting into unknown_template(...) when it should match the existing template: 
the year-to-date fraction for *a quarter* is *a fraction*.

The ontology rule

    a quarter X is previous or equal to a quarter Y 
        if X is previous to Y 
        or X is equal to Y.

should parse to

    clause(is_previous_or_equal_to(L6,M6),or(is_previous_to(L6,M6), equal_to(L6,M6) ))

This requires that a "system template" or "predefined template" exists, as if defined by 

    *a thing* is equal to *another thing*

, so let's have a le_system_template table, in a separate module file le_system_templates.le used by le_grammar

In the ontology fact arguments, when parsing token sequences to atoms you should concatenate the atoms with '_'. So for example "quarter 1 is a quarter" should produce is_a(quarter_1,quarter)

ontology facts should have no singleton variables, they typicall have only constants. So for example "Q1 is previous to Q2" should parse to is_previous_to('Q1','Q2')

## Restarting our vibe and build transtive_is_a
You are an expert in Logical English (LE), a constrained natural language mapping to PROLOG. It is described in @docs/le_syntax.md. There are examples in @examples/moreExamples - all files with extension .le
Consider the working LE parser in @le_grammar.pl, and related files le_system_templates.pl and tokenizer.pl

Using the information provided in the parsing of the ontology section, build a temporary (thread_local) is_a(Type,SuperType) predicate with all is_a facts and clauses; make also a validation agains loops in the is_a tree, so please write a loop checker and report a parsing issue if a loop is found; also define transitive_is_a(Type,SuperType) which calls is_a/2.


## multiple errors
It would be nice to report several parser errors, not just the first. For example, parsing moreExamples/payg_buggy.le should result in two errors

## le_kbs module

You are an expert in Logical English (LE), a constrained natural language mapping to PROLOG. It is described in @docs/le_syntax.md. There are examples in @examples/moreExamples - all files with extension .le.
Now create a simple LE knowledge bases manager, a new module file le_kbs.pl, importing le_grammar. Its main predicate is load(FilePath,NewModule) which:
1) Creates a new module name M, from a variant_sha1 of the FilePath and its modification date
2) calls parse_le, takes the doc AST term term and keeps its information in several relations in the new module M:
- a single fact le_kb(KBname)
- scenario(Name,FactsList),
- query(Name,Goal)
- PROLOG clauses with the LE program rules and is_a clauses; these will not be executable dirctly (we will introduce an interpreter later), but stored as is
- All previous asserts should keep the respective clause references, so that for each one you can add a fact le_source(ClauseRef, BeginPosition,EndPosition), preserving the information from the positions of the parsed tokens 

## Sessions

We'll now add session modules,  mutable counterparts to the imutable KBmodules. The session module will represent the mutable data of a LE program in its KBmodule, which is imutable. E.g. provide workspace specific to a session.  Later our future meta-interpreter will decide when it needs to use this data.

Add to le_kbs.pl these predicates:
 - createSection(KBmodule,NewSessionModule) , which given a KB module as produced by load/2 returns a new module (named with a new uuid) with working memory for a LE session. Assert in it a le_my_kb(KBmnodule) fact. Declare in it a single le_neg/1 dynamic relation for negated facts; 
 - addSessionFact(SessionModule,Fact), which asserts Fact into SessionModule, recording its clause ref in a relation sessionClause(Ref)
 - negateSessionFact(SessionModule,Fact), which will retract any matching facts from the session and assert a le_neg(Fact) fact
 - setScenarion(SessionModule,ScenarionName): this copies the facts in the scenarion in the session's kb into the session module, by calling addSessionFact
 - clearSession(SessionModule), which erases all facts previously asserted, by using their clause refs in sessionClause/1; it then reases all facts in sessionCluase/1
 - printSession(SessionModule), which prints the session id (module name), its kb name and the current facts 

Write a simple program exxample.pl which uses the parser and le_kbs.pl to create a simple session witn a scenarion for the citizenship.le example

## Running queries

We'll now add to le_kbs.pl a predicate query(SessionModule,Template, TemplateInstance) which:
- converts Template to a Prolog literal Goal, using dict(...) in the KB module of the session
- Calls Goal in the SessionModule
- Converts the bound Goal to TemplateInstance, again using dict(...)

Then another predicate queryScenario(SessionModule,ScenarioName,TemplateInstance), which sets a scenario and then calls the previous query(...)

for this to work we also need the session module to import its KB module - set that up  when you create the session; also we need these meta predicates defined in le_kbs.pl, so that the rule bodies can be executed in PROLOG:

and(A,B):- A,B.

or(A,_) :- A,
or(_,B) :- B.

not(A) :- \+ A.

Then alter examples/appExample1.pl so it runs a couple of queries

## Running queries (Take 2)
You are an expert in Logical English (LE), a constrained natural language mapping to PROLOG. It is described in @docs/le_syntax.md. There are examples in @examples/moreExamples - all files with extension .le. 
We already have a working parser in @le_grammar.pl and a loader in @le_kbs.pl, as well as an incomplete predicate query(SessionModule, Template, TemplateInstance, Unknowns, Why), which calls i(..)

Create a new module reasoner.pl defining the missing predicate i(Goal,SessionModule,Unknowns,Why), a PROLOG-like meta-interpreter for LE, where:
- Goal is a LE goal, expressed in PROLOG literals (not LE templates)
- SessionModule is the module containing facts to be considered prior to LE program clauses; it is created by createSession/2, and contains a fact le_my_kb(KBmodule) indicating in which module the LE program clauses are
- Unknowns is a (possibly empty) list of PROLOG literals that could not be evaluated either because of (a) floundering or (b) being declared as le_unknown(TemplateInstance) in the KBmodule; normal executions without floundering will return an empty Unknowns list; the Unknowns lisrt can be seen as the conditions for the returned Goal bindings to be true (a conditional answer)
- Why is an explanation tree, made of two kinds of nodes: success(IntermediateGoalAnswer,MatchingClauseRef,Children) and failure(IntermediateGoalCall,PredicateIndicator,Children). success(...) subtrees are built by the interpreter, they're proof trees basic ally; failure(..) subtrees are trees of failed goals and must be built at the end of execution from asserted facts

## Fixing it
I don't like the way failure trees are built. Do not use i_failure, but instead use a goal call counter, assert a binary relationship called(ParentID,ChildID,ChildCallTerm) when handling literals, and build the tree at the end of execution.

Please scrap that complicated build_failure_tree(...) predicate entirely, as well as the goal counter. Let's make this work first only with positive (success) explanations.

As one can see at the end of appExmple1.pl (which I have altered slightly), query answers miss variable bindings:

...
Current Facts:
  sd9d6317a-3783-11f1-9059-6ba83b5eedce:is_born_in_on(John,[the,UK],date(2021,10,9)) :- true
  sd9d6317a-3783-11f1-9059-6ba83b5eedce:is_after_commencement(date(2021,10,9)) :- true
  sd9d6317a-3783-11f1-9059-6ba83b5eedce:is_the_mother_of(Alice,John) :- true
  sd9d6317a-3783-11f1-9059-6ba83b5eedce:is_a_British_citizen_on(Alice,date(2021,10,9)) :- true
  sd9d6317a-3783-11f1-9059-6ba83b5eedce:le_neg(is_a(Alice,person)) :- true

Running queries:
Query 1 Result: [_22768,acquires,British,citizenship,on,_22798]
Query 2 Result: [_26672,is,the,mother,of,_26702]

## Running tests

Now let's add a test suite runner. The LE test suite  already exists, it is the set of all .le files in moreExamples/ for which there is a .le.tests file. Each of these files contains the expected answers for all program queries and scenarios, in PROLOG facts expected(QueryName,ScenarioName,ListOfTemplateInstances). Please add a runTestsFor(LE_tests_file,Result) predicate to le_kbs.pl which given a tests file loads the corresponding LE program, and runs the queries in  scenarios as dictated by expected(...). Then add a variant to accept a directory argument instead of LE_tests_file, which iterates over all test files in the directory

let's make sure first that the tests for citizenship.le work fine

I see that you reordered the templates in citizenship.le, so that *a person* says that *a sentence*, came first. IF I reorder them into the original order, as I just did in citizenship.le, there is an error:

ERROR: m76c279100630b5341cfaaf647f3ce0f8c53c5338:is_the_father_of/2: Unknown procedure: m76c279100630b5341cfaaf647f3ce0f8c53c5338:and/2

etc.


The first time I run time(runTestsInDir('examples/moreExamples/',R)) it takes about 2 seconds. Running it again takes 9 seconds.
This suggests some problem managing loading of programs, or something else

## negative explanations
Let's now add negative explanations to the reasoner. We'll use the same last argument Why in i(...), as follows:
- Every goal literal will have an ID, kept by a global counter
- When a literal calls another, assert a thread_local fact called(ParentID,My\ID,MyCallTerm)
- When ending i(...), enhance the positive explanatin tree with failed subtrees (under not(..) subgoals)
- When a not(G)) subgoal suceeds, the positive (success) explanation subtree will be the failure tree for G
These changes must be local to reasoner.pl and not alter the overall reasoner results

Explanations are currently over detaioled. We need to ignore the trivial LE connectives (and, or) retaining only the "juicy" elements supporting the conclusion

## web api
Create a new module classic_web_api.pl implementing a web API as described in docs/api.md, which uses le_kbs. Implement all methods except le2prolog, answer_via_llm and draft.
Then create an example client shell script appExample1_web.sh using curl to test the classic_web_api, similar to appExample1.pl

## Editor
You are a Logical English (@docs/le_syntax.md) expert, and also an expert on Language Server Protocol and the Monaco LSP client,  https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor. We need a cute, simple browser based editor for LE programs, so please implement (ALL changes for this need to go into directory editor/ ):
- a LSP server for Logical English, written in Typescript, so it is fully browser based; to write the Typescript you should introspect the DCG rules and tokens in le_grammar.pl
- a simple static web page using Monaco, receiving the LE text in the URL; later versions will load LE text from other sources; this first version will not be able to save - only edit and display coloured LE locally

    for inspiration: https://github.com/nikolaimerritt/LogicalEnglish/blob/main/report/FinalReport/main.pdf

First, add a method to our docs/api.md to return the names of all LE examples in (hardwired path) "examples/moreExamples", and implement it in classic_web_api.pl
Then a "Open from server" item to the File menu which opens a modal dialog to pick any of the avaialble LE examples, fetched it from the server and loads it into the editor; prior to all this, warn the user to dave any changes

## Editor querying

Now add a panel below the editor, with two popup menus: one for scenarios, the other for queries. When the user presses either, the editor client should ask the server (cf. docs/api.md) to load the editor text as a new LE module, obtaining the queries and examples in the program. the server should be asked for this only once (until the editor changes the program text). Then add also a Query button, which will execute the selected query and scenarion on the editor program; and a field below to depict the answers obtained

## Explanations

At the end of query/5 in le_kbs.pl, postprocess the explanation term to replace clause refs by character position ranges, as obtained from le_source; review convert_why in classic_web_api.pl accordingly, so explanations will contain character positions rather than clause refs.
Then back to the UI: Split the RESULTS panel in two: the left continues to show the last answers for the selected query, but each answer is clickable; when clicked, the right panel will show the explanation tree for the answer. IF no answers, the explanation will be the negative explanation.
Explanation objects are in the 'why' fields.
Finally, make each explanation tree node clickable: when clicked, the editor should select the respective text range

next...:

First, we need to keep source positions for scenarion facts, so navigation from the explanation tree to code is commplete. Thise requires a revision of setScenarion/2 (probably)
Another issue is the explanation nodes: the explanation post processing should also add to the explanation nodes a "bound template" version of the PROLOG literal; and the explanation tree rendering in the UI should use that

About "Open from server...": please rename to "Open copy from server..."; and make it refresh the example name at the top of the window
Also make the session ID a bit larger, and justify it to the right of tht window

## Indentation
Let's please indent the code in all our .pl files in a different manner, without altering its functionality. Specifically, we need PROLOG if-then-else constructs laid out differently. So for example instead of 

explain(Goal, SessionModule, Unknowns, Whys) :-
    retractall(called(_, _, _)),
    init_counter,
    (   SessionModule:le_my_kb(KBmodule) ->  true;   KBmodule = none
    ),
    (   solve(Goal, SessionModule, KBmodule, [], 0, 0, Unknowns, Whys)
    ->  true
    ;   Unknowns = [],
        findall(W, (called(0, CID, _), build_failure_tree(CID, Ws), member(W, Ws)), Whys)
    ).

...please write the above instead as:
explain(Goal, SessionModule, Unknowns, Whys) :-
    retractall(called(_, _, _)),
    init_counter,
    ( SessionModule:le_my_kb(KBmodule) ->  true; KBmodule = none),
    (   solve(Goal, SessionModule, KBmodule, [], 0, 0, Unknowns, Whys) ->  true 
        ;   
        Unknowns = [],
        findall(W, (called(0, CID, _), build_failure_tree(CID, Ws), member(W, Ws)), Whys)
    ).

Notice that if a if-then-else construct is small (as in the first above) we keep it in a single line; otherwise we indent and split lines as in the second.

For longer, multi branch if-then elses use a terser version; for example instead of:

extract_var_name(Words, Name) :-
    (   Words = [Art | Rest], Rest \== [], is_article(Art) ->  
        length(Rest, L), L =< 5,
        extract_id(Rest, Name)
        ;   
        Words = [each | Rest], Rest \== [] ->  
        length(Rest, L), L =< 5,
        extract_id(Rest, Name)
        ;   
        Words = [which | Rest], Rest \== [] ->  
        length(Rest, L), L =< 5,
        extract_id(Rest, Name)
        ;   
        Words = [who] -> Name = who
        ;   
        Words = [what] -> Name = what
        ;   
        Words = [when] -> Name = when
        ;   
        Words = [where] -> Name = where
        ;   
        Words = [W], is_id(W) -> Name = W
    ).

...use:
extract_var_name(Words, Name) :-
    (   Words = [Art | Rest], Rest \== [], is_article(Art) ->  
            length(Rest, L), L =< 5,
            extract_id(Rest, Name)
        ; Words = [each | Rest], Rest \== [] ->  
            length(Rest, L), L =< 5,
            extract_id(Rest, Name)
        ; Words = [which | Rest], Rest \== [] ->  
            length(Rest, L), L =< 5,
            extract_id(Rest, Name)
        ; Words = [who] -> Name = who
        ; Words = [what] -> Name = what
        ; Words = [when] -> Name = when
        ; Words = [where] -> Name = where
        ; Words = [W], is_id(W) -> Name = W
    ).

Some single line if-then-elses are too long for a single line. For example:

second_pass_ontology_item(Templates, rule(Head, BodyTokens, Indent, Start, End), clause(NewHead, NewBody, Start, End)) :-
    ( parse_literal(Head, Templates, [], VM1, NewHead, true) -> parse_body(BodyTokens, Indent, Templates, VM1, _VMOut, NewBody); NewHead = unknown_template(Head, Start, End), parse_body(BodyTokens, Indent, Templates, [], _VMOut, NewBody)).

...should be instead:

second_pass_ontology_item(Templates, rule(Head, BodyTokens, Indent, Start, End), clause(NewHead, NewBody, Start, End)) :-
    ( parse_literal(Head, Templates, [], VM1, NewHead, true) -> 
        parse_body(BodyTokens, Indent, Templates, VM1, _VMOut, NewBody)
        ; 
        NewHead = unknown_template(Head, Start, End), 
        parse_body(BodyTokens, Indent, Templates, [], _VMOut, NewBody)
    ).

## expected answers
Let's add an optional construct for scenarios: "QueryName expects answers ListOfAnswers.". This is intended to replace the need for .le.tests files. For example the first fact in citizenship.le.tests will be represented like this in scenario 'alice':

scenario alice is:
    John is born in the UK on 2021-10-09.
	2021-10-09 is after commencement.
	Alice is the mother of John.
	Alice is a British citizen on 2021-10-09.
    one expects answers ["John acquires British citizenship on 2021-10-9T0:0:0.0"].

Considering this design:
- Enhance the parser to recognize it
- Represent the information into a new system predicate le_expected(Queryname,ScenarioName,listOfAnswers) in the KB module
- Review the runTests etc. predicates to use both this new predicate and the legacy .le.tests files, which we will continue to support
- Move all expected/3 facts from the .le.tests into the .le files

## Warnings and error in the editor
We need to show in the editor any errors (detected by the parser) and warnings (as produced by le_verifier:verify(..)); I suggest using red and yellow respectively.
And also make sure that if there are errors the Query button is disabled (with a tooltip referring the presence of errors)

## MCP server
Implement a new module llm/mcp.pl with a Model Context Protocol Server written in SWI-PROLOG, via HTTP at endpoint /mcp, with the following tools:
- list LE program example names and their summaries 
- Execute an arbitrary query for either a named program example or a given program text, obtaining answers with explanations
- parse and verify a new program, returning all issues found (syntax, warnings, failed tests)
Also provide example settings files for Claude Code, Claude Desktop and ChatGPT Pro

## which
Let's introduce a new LE keyword 'which', a short hand for conjunction plus referencing a variable. For example, instead of writing, in royal_family.le,

a person is an ancestor of a descendant if 
    the person is a parent of a child and 
    the child is an ancestor of the descendant.

...we want to write the equivalent:

a person is an ancestor of a descendant if 
    the person is a parent of a child
    which is an ancestor of the descendant.

Furthermore, we want to use this LE extension to define a methodology for future extensions: the changes needed (probably) to le_grammar.pl and le_kbs.pl should be in a separate file, loaded by the main system if present.

## vibe coding LE
We want to add an agentic/vibe coding ability to our editor, by using opencode.ai as a PROLOG subprocess via its command line interface (cf. https://opencode.ai/docs/cli/). The flow will be like this:
- The user must provide at least one API key, as expected by llm_client.pl. The key is to be provided in a new modal dialog invoked from the Misc menu, where the user may pick any of the models in llm_model_entry(..), and it is to be stored in browser storage
- The bottom panels of the editor need to morph into a new simple (bottom) tabbed pane UI, its first, default, pane being "Query", with what we have now; then with a new second pane "LE Assistant" 
- The LE Assistant pane should have a chat like UI, with scrolling history at the top and a bottom field for user commands.
- When the user types something in the Assistant command field, like "Fix indentation" or "draft me a LE program encoding parking regulations in London", opencode is called from the PROLOG side, via its CLI; it should use a new specific AGENTS.md (different from the AGENTS.md we have already), inspired in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LogicalContracts/LogicalEnglish/refs/heads/main/CLAUDE.md BUT not using shell commands, and instead using our own MCP server for program verification. And feel free to revise it! 
-  So Editor calls Prolog which calls opencode which possibly calls (same, but in different thread...) PRolog MCP server - in addition to going out to the web etc as opencode does.
- The whole text in the editor is the main implicit argument for the prompt, passed as a temporary text file so that opencode can edit in the server, and then hand it back so the editor replaces the displayed text with the new version. Multiple user commands will correspond to multiple opencode commands, so these need to use the same shared (opencode) session for all of them. 
  
Do not install opencode yourself, the user should do that.

### LE Assistant Light
The LE Assistant is described in @docs/le_assistant.md. We need an alternative, lighter implementation, which reuses the current LE Assistant ingredients (AGENTS_LE_template, LLM API keys, etc,), but differs in that:
- does not use Opencode; has a simpler agentic loop, Prolog based; use custom tools for ```verify```and ```query```, making direct PROLOG calls, instead of calling MCP
- Prolog calls LLMs directly, using llm_client.pl, and assembling a bigger prompt with all relevant LE examples, LE syntax etc. This may recommend some changes to AGENTS_LE_template, so that both generic agentic systems like Opencode and our new Prolog agentic loop can extract the relevant file paths
- No need for temporary directory nor myProgram.le; PROLOG iterates on an evolving version of myProgram.le

For now do not implement this, just write a docs/le_assistant_light.md describing the new assistant and its elements; this is to use the same chat UI as the current assistant (just with a checkbox to select "Light" vs "Deep").

#### Gemini 3.5 over optimistic response:
Summary of Changes
1. Shared In-Process Tools (le_tools.pl):
- Created a new module le_tools.pl containing shared, in-process implementations of le_tool_verify/2 and le_tool_query/2.
- Refactored llm/mcp.pl to import and use le_tools.pl, eliminating code duplication.
2. Prolog-Native Agentic Loop (le_assistant_light.pl):
- Implemented run_light_assistant/7 and agent_loop/8 to drive the LLM directly via llm/llm_client.pl.
- Added assemble_system_prompt/2 to inline instructions, the full docs/le_summary.md syntax summary, and curated examples (citizenship.le, numbering_test.le).
- Implemented the text-based JSON action protocol (verify, query, edit, finish) with robust parsing and nudge-and-retry logic.
3. API Key & Concurrency Safety (llm/llm_client.pl):
- Extended llm_request/4 to support an explicit api_key(Key) option, ensuring concurrency-safe key delivery without global state.
4. Dispatcher & Thread-Based Jobs (le_assistant.pl):
- Modified handle_assistant_command/2 to dispatch on mode ("light" vs "deep").
- Implemented thread-based execution for Light mode, asserting progress and final results into the existing assistant_job* dynamic facts to seamlessly integrate with the polling UI.
- Updated handle_assistant_interrupt/2 to support thread-based cooperative interrupts via thread_signal/2.
5. UI Integration (editor/index.html & editor/src/client.ts):
- Added a Light Mode checkbox toggle to the top of the Assistant panel.
- Persisted the toggle state in localStorage (le-assistant-mode).
- Included the mode field in the assistant_command request body.

*(some debugging followed)*

## 3 features...
Please implement the following 3 featurfes, in sequence:

### prolog calling
Let's let the user define special rules whose body is a single PROLOG goal, so that we can interface to system predicates outside LE. For example:

a person has an age if
    prolog myModule:myAgeFinder(the person, the age).

... where  myAgeFinder(P,A) is a  predicate in module myModule.

### Rules with IDs

Let the user prefix a rule by an arbitrary alphanumeric ID, with the simple syntax:

rule myID:
myRuleHead if myRuleBody.

The ID should be remembered in an extra argument in le_source(...). If the user provides no ID, the system should generate one ID based on the order of the rule in the LE file.

Also provide a PROLOG predicate le_my_id(ID) which introspects the current rule ID during execution.

Write a simple example testing rule IDs and checking rule ID discover with le_my_id , by using the prolog calling feature above


### Rules with numbering

Let's support an alternative syntax to Logical English rules, distinguished from regular rules by using "if:". In this syntax, indentation is irrelevant for the scoping of logic connectives, which is instead determined by item numbering.
For example, instead of writing...

An A has a relevant asset B if
    the A is affiliated with a C and
    the C is connected to a D and
    the D owns the B and
        the B is used in the business of the A
    or
            the A is connected to an E and
            the B is used in the business of the E.

...we will be able to also write the same rule as follows:

An A has a relevant asset B if:
1.the A is affiliated with a C; and
2.the C is connected to a D; and
3.the D owns the B; and
4.one of:
4.1. the B is used in the business of the A;or
4.2. all of:
4.2.1. the A is connected to an E; and
4.2.2. the B is used in the business of the E.

These hierarchical designators of each sub-condition can use letters, digits, roman numbers, as found usually in legal documents

Furthermore, let's keep track of how those hierarchical designators relate to their specific rule components (sub-conditions), by adding a new predicate le_source_element(RuleID, HierarchicalDesignator, Prolog_goal) to the KB module. 

Implement this addition to the parser, BUT keeping the bulk of changes in le_extensions.pl, because this will be an optional feature in LE.
Add an example testing this feature, by recovering the hierarchical designators of a rule given its ID, and using the prolog keyword to access le_source_element.

For this you will need to also implement a le_my_kb(KBmodule), which returns the KB module of the current rule.

### Report on the 3 features....
We have successfully implemented and verified the three requested features: Prolog calling, Rule IDs, and Hierarchical Numbering.
Key Achievements
- Prolog Calling: Rules can now execute arbitrary Prolog goals using the prolog keyword. LE variables are automatically unified with Prolog variables.
- Rule IDs: Rules can be explicitly named (e.g., rule myRule: ...) or will receive auto-generated IDs (rule_1, rule_2, etc.). These IDs are stored in the KB metadata.
- Hierarchical Numbering: Rules can use hierarchical numbering (e.g., 1., 1.1., a.) with the if: separator. The structure is automatically converted into nested and/or logic, and each numbered element is tracked in le_source_element/3.
- Introspection: Rules can now use le_my_id(ID) and le_my_kb(KB) to identify themselves and their parent Knowledge Base module at runtime.
Verification Results
- New Feature Tests: prolog_call.le, rule_id_test.le, and numbering_test.le all pass their corresponding .tests suites.
- Regression Testing: 173 out of 175 total tests in the repository are passing. The two remaining failures in cgt_assets.le appear to be pre-existing logic discrepancies in the test data rather than regressions from the new features.
- Code Quality: Resolved all syntax errors, singleton variable warnings, and module permission issues encountered during development.
Relevant Files Updated
- le_grammar.pl: Updated DCG to support rule headers, prolog tokens, and if: separators.
- le_extensions.pl: Implemented the core logic for Prolog token resolution and hierarchical numbering parsing.
- le_kbs.pl: Updated KB loading, metadata management, and added introspection predicates.
- reasoner.pl: Updated the meta-interpreter to maintain rule ID and KB module context using non-backtrackable global variables.
The system is now stable and the new features are fully integrated into the Logical English environment.

## Fix rules with numbering
The rule IDs and hierarchical designators in rule conditions as alternative to indentation... are not working completely. Consider the revised LE file examples/moreExamples/numbering_test.le .
Make sure the answers to query one include rule jd

## Unless
We need a new construct in LE rules, 'unless', which may be comboned with 'and'. Here is an example of use:

the templates are:
we will make *a payment* for *an incident* under *a policy*.
*an incident* is covered.
*a policy* is cancelled.

% and now rules with 'unless':

rule one.
we will make a payment for an incident under a policy if 
    the incident is covered and unless the policy is canceled.

rule two.
we will make a payment for an incident under a policy unless 
     the policy is canceled.

rule one above is equivalent to:

we will make a payment for an incident  if 
    the incident is covered and 
    it is not the case that 
        the policy is canceled.

rule two is equivalent to:

we will make a payment for an incident if
    it is not the case that
        the policy is canceled.

Notice that 'unless' can by itself signal the presence of a rule.

Build a simple testing example for this construct, and implement it in the parser etc. The bulk of its implementation should go into le_extensions.
Please remember to support it in the editor (colouring, word completion)

## Debugging negative explanations

In example 4_affiliates_3.le, scenario test, query one, the following explanation subtree is incorrect:

- it is not the case that his company is a superannuation fund
  - his company is a superannuation fund
    - his company is a superannuation fund
      - his company is a superannuation fund
        - his company is a superannuation fund according to other legislation
            his company is a superannuation fund according to other legislation
        his company is a company
      - company is a superannuation fund
        - company is a superannuation fund according to other legislation
            company is a superannuation fund according to other legislation

It has redudant nodes, and an incorrect subtree. It should be just:

- it is not the case that his company is a superannuation fund
  - his company is a superannuation fund
    - his company is a superannuation fund
        - his company is a superannuation fund according to other legislation

This seems a problem in reasoner.pl

---
Navigation is now fine, but can we have that exaple failed subtree as just:

- it is not the case that his company is a superannuation fund
  - his company is a superannuation fund
        - his company is a superannuation fund according to other legislation
        - 
...? I see no reason to repeat the "his company is a superannuation fund" node

### Gemini's comment...
I have fixed the redundant nodes and incorrect subtrees in the explanation tree.
The issues were:
1.  Redundant Nesting: The meta-interpreter was recording every call, including those that were just wrappers like le_at. This caused multiple identical-looking nodes in the tree.
2.  Incorrect Subtrees: The is_a transitivity logic was producing irrelevant failure paths (like company is a superannuation fund) when a direct rule already explained the failure.
3.  Negation Redundancy: solve_real(not(Goal)) was asserting a called fact for Goal even if it was already wrapped in le_at, adding another layer of redundancy.
I modified reasoner.pl to:
1.  Skip Trivial Goals in solve: Trivial goals like le_at no longer assert a called fact, preventing them from appearing as redundant nodes.
2.  Strip le_at in Negation: solve_real(not(Goal)) now strips any le_at wrapper before recording the call to Goal, ensuring a cleaner root for the failure tree.
3.  Enhanced Variant Collapsing in build_failure_tree: The failure tree construction now more aggressively collapses nodes that are variants of each other, even if one is wrapped in le_at.
4.  Filter Successful Branches in Failure Trees: I implemented a succeeded/1 fact to track successful goals and ensure they don't appear in failure trees, which also helped eliminate the "nonsense" transitivity paths that were partially successful.

## original queries in LE

In the Query panel the query menu is showing templates. Show instead the textual query as in the LE program (it may be available in query_info(...)), and show the selected (query) template instead as a tooltip when the user hovers the Query button

## Templates confusing "is a"
Some LE templates are being confused with "is a". 
For example in examples/moreExamples/augmentedsem.le, template "*a label* is a label for *a description*" implies that, in line 24, "X is a label for Latitude" should be translated into PROLOG as is_a_label_for/2 - not to is_a/2.

Good, now for something else:
We also need "is of" to be recognized as a synonym for "is a". So for example in examples/moreExamples/augmentedsem.le , rule

an object is of a type
    if a label is a label for the type
    and the object is of the label.  % connection to the dataset 

a type is a variable; interpreting the head as containing the type 'of a type' is incorrect.  

## big conclusions

We now wish to allow nested sentences with 'which' also in rule heads, or simple facts. For example this rule should be acceptable (templates not shown):

we will cover a cost
    which is in respect of a damage
    which is caused by a burst pipe
if 
    it is not the case that
    the damage is caused by wear and tear or negligence.

being equivalent to 

we will cover a cost 
    which is caused by a burst pipe
if 
    the cost is in respect of a damage and
    the damage is caused by a burst pipe and
    it is not the case that
        the damage is caused by wear and tear or negligence.

In summary, which conditions in a head miggrate to the rule body with explicit variables.


Similarly for "facts", for example this fact:

we will cover a cost which is in respect of a damage which is caused by a burst pipe

is equivalent to:

we will cover a cost if
    the cost is in respect of a damage and
    the damage is caused by a burst pipe.

Write a simple example with these or simlar rules and facts for testing, and implement this LE extension ("big conclusions") mainly in le_extensions.pl

### Gemini's comment
I have implemented the "big conclusions" extension for Logical English, allowing nested sentences with which in rule heads and facts.
Changes Implemented:
1.  Big Conclusions Logic (le_extensions.pl):
    *   Added a new extension to the second pass of the parser that identifies which in rule heads and facts.
    *   Implemented big_conclusion/6 to recursively split sentences at which and migrate the resulting conditions into the rule body.
    *   Ensured correct variable unification by prepending a dummy variable token to nested sentences, allowing which to correctly refer to the subject of the preceding clause.
2.  Grammar Enhancements (le_grammar.pl):
    *   Added a second_pass_item_extension/4 multifile hook to allow extensions to override or augment the default clause generation logic.
    *   Updated rule ID parsing to support both words and numbers (e.g., rule 1:).
    *   Adjusted template priorities to ensure system templates like *V1* is in *V2* act as fallbacks and do not aggressively match user-defined templates (e.g., *a cost* is in respect of *a damage*).
3.  Robustness & Cleanup (le_kbs.pl):
    *   Fixed singleton variable warnings and ensured templates are correctly passed through the term transformation pipeline.
    *   Updated 3_rollover_3.le to remove a redundant template declaration that conflicted with the improved priority rules.
4.  Verification:
    *   Created a new test file examples/moreExamples/big_conclusions.le covering nested which in both rules and facts.
    *   Verified that all 182 tests (including the new ones) pass, ensuring no regressions in existing functionality.
Example of Supported Syntax:
The following is now correctly translated into a single Prolog rule with unified variables:
we will cover a cost
    which is in respect of a damage
    which is caused by a burst pipe
if 
    it is not the case that
        the damage is caused by wear and tear or negligence.
This is equivalent to:
we_will_cover(Cost) :-
    is_in_respect_of(Cost, Damage),
    is_caused_by(Damage, BurstPipe),
    not(is_caused_by_wear_and_tear_or_negligence(Damage)).

## explanations are missing for aggregates
For example in sbppxml1.le for scenario one and query indirect the explanation shown is just:

- the indirect small business participation percentage of Tom Fry in Tallow Unit Trust is 0
    0 is the sum of each Po such that
        MISSING

there should be a MISSING node with "the indirect small business participation percentage 1 of the entity in the other entity is Po" - either a failure node, or multiple success nodes, one for each aggregated value; and subtrees under all of these

This may relate to a problem in sbppxml1.le: test failed for query 'indirect' in scenario 'one'.

Expected: [the indirect small business participation percentage of Tom Fry in Tallow Unit Trust is 0.0400000000000001]
Actual: [the indirect small business participation percentage of Tom Fry in Tallow Unit Trust is 0]

The Actual value with 0 is wrong, should be 0.04 (and so should be the expected value above, which we will round to 0.04)

Might the computation of the sum be buggy...?

## broken test
In 3_rollover_3.le, tests are failing, missing answers for query two in scenario "Andrew email Feb 4 2021 version 2":

Expected: [andrew is a party of event 123,company1 is a party of event 123,miguel is a party of event 123]
Actual: [company1 is a party of event 123]

Something preventing backtracking over the rules...?

## another warning
Add another verification in le_verifier.pl: if the user defines a template identical to any of those in le_system_template(...) AND there isn't any rule or fact in the program, issue a warning: "Template .... redefines a similar system template and there are no rules for it", with fixe:
 "Either change the template slightly or add some rules"

## is_a hierarchy

We need a visualization of the is_a hieararchy for a LE program. So please:
- add a predicate is_a_hierarchy(KBmodule,H) to le_kbs.pl which finds all answers for is_a(_,_) on the KB (not using any scenario data) to build the types tree; in each node keep the source location of the fact or rule head producing the node. 
  --To obtain is_a(..) source locations do NOT alter le_grammar.pl, but instead introspect the clauses loaded into the KB module, to collect matching is_a(...) tuples with the source locations
- add some method to classic_web_api.pl to expose that tree to our UI
- add a "See Types Hierarchy" item to the editor's contextual menu, which opens a new window with a simple Javascript based rendering of the tree; tree nodes should navigate back to the editor window, selecting the relevant source code where the type is defined

## explanations for 'says that'
In explanations, some Prolog literals are not beeing shown as template instances. For example in citizenship.le, scenario trust_harry, query one has an explanation which includes a node "Harry says that is_the_father_of('Harry','John')"

## variables colouring in rule,
Variables are coloured in templates in the editor, but not coloured in template instances in rules. For example, in citizenship.le, in rule

a person is the father of an other person
    if a third person says 
    that the person is the father of the other person
    and the third person is qualified to determine fatherhood.

The following fragments above should be coloured as variables:
a person
an other person
a third person
the person
the other person
the third person

## Adjusting rule numbering

We need to (also) allow the use of 'at least one of' as an alternative synonym for 'either', in parse_node_extension (le_extensions.pl).
Please implement this, including adding another rule jd2 to numberingTest.le, identical to jd but using 'at least one of:' instead of 'either:'

## Adjusting unless
We no longer require 'unless' to be preceded by 'and'. So we can write simply:

 we will make a payment for an incident under a policy if 
        the incident is covered unless the policy is cancelled.

Implement this change, adapting also the example in unless_test.le

## clean up some ==s
In le_extensions.le:264 I see a clause with this beginning:

parse_numbered_node(D, Tokens, Children, Templates, VMIn, VMOut, Logic, RuleID, Op, M) :-
    strip_numbered_noise(Tokens, CleanTokens, Op),
    (   (CleanTokens == [] ; CleanTokens == [word(either, _)] ; CleanTokens == [word(any, _), word(of, _)] ; CleanTokens == [word(at, _), word(least, _), word(one, _), word(of, _)]) , Children \== [] ->
        hierarchy_to_numbered_logic(Children, Templates, VMIn, VMOut, Logic0, RuleID, M)
    ;   (CleanTokens == [word(unless, _)] ; CleanTokens == [word(and, _), word(unless, _)]) ->
        (   Children \== [] ->
            hierarchy_to_numbered_logic(Children, Templates, VMIn, VMOut, SubLogic, RuleID, M)
...etc.

Some of the conditions win the diskunctionill always be false, and are redundant. For example:

    CleanTokens == [word(either, _)]

can never be true, because Prolog's '==' operator requires that both terms are identica, down to variables; and because the right operand as an anonymous (and unique) variable, the condition will always be false because it's impossible for that variable to occur in CleanTokend

Clean it up please

## Collecting and using types
Now for a refactoring on how we remember LE types.
In le_grammar.pl a table is built, is_a_type/1. Please:
- Make that a thread_local predicate, for multithreading safety
- When we load(...) a file in le_kbs.pl, obtain from the parse also the list of those types , and assert them into a new le_type/1 predicate in the new knowledge module being loaded.

We now need to use the types in the template for a rule head (when they mention types), so that sometimes (explained below) they be checked at runtime. Specifically, in the last branch of the last clause of solve_real_actual(..), just before calling solve(..), call a new predicate is_type_compatible(..,G) which, for each argument A of G with a type FormalType associated with it in the rule head, checks the following: (le_type(A) -> is_a(A,T) ; true)

Then create an example with a small ontology and two rules illustrating this runtime checking at work, meaning, the type checks acting as hidden conditions supporting different conclusion bindings

### Gemini comment
I have implemented the runtime type checking in the Logical English reasoner as requested.
Changes:
1.  Modified reasoner.pl:
    *   Updated solve_real_actual/8 to call is_type_compatible/3 before solving a rule body.
    *   Implemented is_type_compatible/3, which retrieves the template for a goal and checks if the actual arguments are compatible with the formal types defined in the template.
    *   The check follows the logic: (le_type(A) -> is_a(A, FormalType) ; true). This allows variables in queries to be bound to types that satisfy the hierarchy constraints.
    *   Implemented a robust is_a_simple/3 helper to handle type hierarchy checks (including transitivity) within the target module.
2.  Created Example examples/moreExamples/type_check_test.le:
    *   Ontology: Defines a hierarchy where boy is a man, man is a person, girl is a woman, and woman is a person.
    *   Rules:
        *   a person is happy if the person is strong.
        *   a person is happy if the person is wise.
    *   Facts: boy is strong. and girl is wise.
    *   Query: which person is happy.
    *   Result: The type checks act as hidden conditions. When solving is_happy(P), P is bound to boy (because boy is a person and boy is strong) and girl (because girl is a person and girl is wise).

## fixing the payg test failure

In line 137 of payg.le, the condition "the income year is a year under consideration" is being translated to PROLOG as 
is_a(B, 'year under consideration'), which is incorrect - it should be translated instead to 
"is_a_year_under_consideration(B)", considering the existing template "*a year* is a year under consideration"

I have pinpointed the precise reason of failure of payg.le, scenario ato_1_quarter_2 query 'test': the goal "the amount with an ID was reported as an instalment on a quarter X of the income year", in the rule on line 134, is failing, although there is a fact "3000 with idiAE202501 was reported as an instalment on quarter 1 of 2025". 


the varied amount payable for quarter 2 for 2025 by Australian entity is 9000.0
  the current quarter is quarter 2
  the estimated tax for Australian entity for 2025 is 18000.0
    the estimated annual net tax payable for Australian entity for 2025 is 18000.0
      the estimated taxable income for Australian entity for 2025 is 100000
      the applicable tax rate for Australian entity on 2025 is 0.25
        Australian entity is a base rate entity
        0.25 is 0.25
      the tax offsets for Australian entity for 2025 is 5000
      5000 is greater than or equal to 0
      the estimated tax credits for Australian entity for 2025 are 2000
      2000 is greater than or equal to 0
      18000.0 = 100000*0.25-5000-2000
    18000.0 is greater than or equal to 0
  the year - to - date fraction for quarter 2 is 0.5
    quarter 2 is quarter 2
    0.5 is 0.5
  the year - to - date instalment adjustment for Australian entity for 2025 is 0
    Australian entity is the taxpayer
    the current quarter is quarter 2
    2025 is a year under consideration
    IR is the sum of each amount such that
      RED:   an amount with an ID was reported as an instalment on a quarter of 2025
    IVC is the sum of each number such that
      an amount with an ID was reported as a variation on a quarter of 2025
    0 = 0-0
  9000.0 = 18000.0*0.5-0

## Explanations closer to LE1
In the EXPLANATION tree panel, let the user chose to optionally see an hierachical number prefix in each node, to make it easy to refer to them. Make this choice in the Misc menu, and persist the choice in browser storage
Also, make the theme choice of the editor reflect in the explanation tree and query panel too

## Blockly

We now wish to view and edit a LE program with a Blockly (https://developers.google.com/blockly) editor. First, before any coding, let's just draft a docs/le_blockly.md document describing functionality for Blockly-based editor for LE

## LE Source Graph
Implement a new panel to complement our editor, following specification in docs/graphDesign.md

### Gemini comment
I have implemented the new Graph panel for the Logical English editor, following the specification in docs/graphDesign.md.
Key Features Implemented:
- Interactive Graph Rendering: Built with Cytoscape.js and the fCoSE layout engine to handle compound nodes (Knowledge Bases and Scenarios).
- Node & Edge Types:
    - Nodes: Knowledge Base (compound), Template/Predicate, Rule, Fact, Type, Scenario (compound), and Query.
    - Edges: uses, defines, is-a, depends-on, negates, and expects.
- Bidirectional Navigation:
    - Graph to Editor: Clicking a node highlights its corresponding source range in the Monaco editor.
    - Editor to Graph: Moving the caret in the editor automatically focuses the most specific node in the graph containing that offset.
- Graph Controls:
    - Refresh: Manually reload the graph from the server.
    - Layout Selection: Choose between fCoSE, CoSE, Grid, and Circle layouts.
    - Type Filtering: Toggle visibility of Type nodes.
    - Search: Real-time search that highlights matching nodes and dims others.
- Server-Side Support:
    - New Prolog module le_graph.pl to generate the Cytoscape-compatible JSON structure.
    - Updated classic_web_api.pl with a new graph operation.
Technical Details:
- Frontend: Added cytoscape and cytoscape-fcose dependencies. Updated client.ts with graph logic and index.html with the new tabbed UI.
- Backend: Implemented robust node and edge collection in Prolog, ensuring deterministic IDs and stable source range mapping.
To see the changes, build the editor and start the server:
cd editor && npm install && npm run build

### Improve these
-Edge labels are fine, but add tooltips to provide some more detail, for example in 'uses' (from rules to templates) it should be 'rule uses template').
-Facts should exclude system facts like le_kb(..) etc
-I like the templates colour, so render rule nodes with the same colour
-LEt the "Open in new window" button have a normal aspect, like tthe other buttons; no need for the special color

## big conclusions

### global abbreviations
Let's a add a feature to our LE templates, the ability to abbreviate a reference to a "global" fact. Consider the following extended template, ending with ";" which indicates an addition, the defining of two abbreviations:

our policy is *a policy*;  
    defines global this policy; 
    defines global your policy.   

The template "our policy is *a policy*" continues to be handled as before. BUT wherever the LE program mentions the abbreviations 'this policy' or 'your policy', that will mean the value X determined by the condition "our policy is X"

In other words, p(this policy) <-> our policy is X and p(X)

Look into @examples/moreExamples/globals.le, which already includes tests (expectations in scenarios) to verify your implementation. 

### opposite and only if
Another feature please, actually a pair: 
- 'only if' rules (as alternative to the existing 'if' rules)
- 'opposite' template addition, indicating how a negated (predicate) template should be written

So for example:

the templates are:
    I will marry *a woman*; opposite I will not marry *a woman*.
    I love *a woman*.

I will marry a woman only if
    I love the woman.

This means (and will be translated to the PROLOG equivalent of):

I will not marry a woman if
    it is not the case that
        I love the woman.

Please create a new file examples/moreExamples/only_if.le with the above and a couple of other examples of your own, together with expected answers for testing... and implement this feature pair.

### prepositional additions
Another Logical English feature please : an optional additon to templates to let them define prepositional phrases, typically to be       
  combined with a simpler template. This is intended for binary predicates only; a "prepositional" template must start with an argument,    
  and it allows omitting that first argument when chaining to a type-compatible last arg of the previous condition. For example, consider   
  these templates:                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                            
  the templates are:                                                                                                                        
      we will make *a payment* ;                                                                                                            
      *a payment* under *a policy*;  prepositional.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                            
  These will allow the following to be written:                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                            
      we will make a payment under this policy                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                            
  ...instead of the more verbose (also legitimate)                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                            
      we will make a payment and the payment under this policy                                                                              
                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                            
  When this occurs in a rule head, the prepositional tamplates originate new conditions in the PROLOG body; when in a rule body, additional 
   conditions too.                                                                                                                          
  A template with a 'prepositional' additional must have strictly two arguments, and its string must start with an argument at the very     
  begining, otherwise it's an error to be reported.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                            
  There is an expanded example in examples/moreExamples/big_conclusions.le.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                            
  First, improve our system to make sure it is able to parse it.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                            
  Then add it a few scenarios and queries and expected answers, so that you can test this... and implement it!                              

#### move to le_extensions.pl
The latest LE engine feature committed yesterday to git (ff951b132307ca573c723c490e6163c3fd881303), "prepositional template additions", needs to have some of its code moved into le_extensions.pl. Strong candidate for another multifile declaration: match_template_with_chaining/8. This feature is proprietary, and should not work if le_extensions.pl is not present - meaning LE should work normally but lacking that feature. Notice that le_extensions.pl in our directory is a link to ../InsurLE2/le_extensions.pl, which you are allowed to edit.

## hierarchical examples
the examles/moreExamples directory now has sub-directories. Revise the test runner to make sure it still runs tests in all files; and the web interface so it shows the example list with sub dir names and simple indentation

## unknowns
Add another prepositional addition, 'unknown', intended to specify facts for le_unknown/1. Here is a trivial example:

the templates are:
    *a person* knows that *a number* will win the lottery; unknown.
    *a person* becomes rich.
    *a person* bets *a number* timely.

the knowledge base unknowns includes:

a person becomes rich if
    the person knows that a number will win the lottery and
    the person bets the number timely.

Add something like that (be creative!) and a few small examples of your own to examples/moreExamples/unknowns.le, with expected results (read on). Then implement:
- parsing of the unknown addition
- extend scenario expectations' syntax: allow for optional 'and unknowns' complement, as in: "queryQ expects answers ListOfSentences and unknowns ListOfUnknownSentences"

In the EXPLANATION panel make the "unknown" explanation nodes yellow or orange, with a tooltip explaining it

Do NOT commit your changes to git. i will do it later.

### unknown instances
In addition to the 'unknown' addition to a template, let's add a related feature declaring a predicate instance as unknown, a 'it is unknown whether' statement. 

For example:

the templates are:
    *a payment* is in respect of *a claim*.
   ...

the knowledge base myKB includes:
    ...rules
    it is unknown whether any payment is in respect of claim 01. 
    ...more rules...

That "it is unknown whether..." statement should map to a le_unknown(...) fact with the second predicate argument for is_in_respect_of(..) bound to '01', and first argument unbound. 

Please add an example rule and scenarion for testing to unknowns.le, and implement this.

### unknowns in scenarios
Another Logical English language feature: a tweak to 'unknown facts"; let such statements occur only as part of scenarios. Because in some scenarios something may be unknown, but not in others.

So scenarios will continue to have facts, expected answers and unknonwns, and now.... also statements declaring that a specific instance of a template is unknown.

Add a simple example to unknowns.le and implement this feature: parser, scenario representation, reasoner. 
While you're at it, colour 'it is unknown whether' as reserve3d words (just like "scenario", "expects answers", etc.)
And update le_summary.md

## Modules

We now want to let one LE program include others. For this we'll have a new construct "...includes these resources",  which must precede our regular "the knowledge base myKB includes:" header:

the knowledge base myKB includes these resources:
    Resource1, ..., ResourceN.
the knowledge base myKB includes:
    <rules as usual>

Each of the named resources, separated by commas, must be a well formed LE designated as follows, alternatively:
- relative file path
- URL

In both cases the '.le' extension is implicit. So for example we could have an expanded citizenship_including.le like this:

<templates...>
the knowledge base citizenship_including includes these resources:
    royal_family, https://le2.logicalcontracts.com/source/royal_family .

the knowledge base citizenship_including includes:
<local rules..>

What does "include another LE program mean": 
- The included rules, facts, templates, ontology are added to the local KB module, after existing ones (assertz); and are used during reasoning
- Scenarios and queries are not included
- The including KB's meaning requires successful including of all the remote resources: expected answers assume that; syntactic colouring assumes that too (by colouring included template occurrences in local rules)

So please implement these steps:
- new citizenship_including.le example, including a local file (perhaps some variant of royal_family.le, or some new other one that you like doing) and a remote resource; also create a new small example citizenship_premier.le with facts a few about Premier League soccer players, to be included via URL. Include expected answers for each.
- classic_web_api change: new web endpoint /source to serve the raw LE source text of an example; the example path MUST be allowed in a new env var ALLOWED_LE_EXPORTS defining a list of strict paths to directories in the server's example dir; just "examples/moreExamples" for starters
- parser changes
  - in addition to "the knowledge base <name> includes these resources:", accept also the alternative form "the contract citizenship_including includes these resources:"
- le_kbs and reasoner: loading the includer KB entails immediately loading the included resources; add remote LE fetcher (for URL resources);later we may add some authentication mechanics, but not now
- editor changes: colouring, and also had tooltips to the included resources, showing rule and template counts of the included resource. Otherwise only local KB items are editable as usual
- update le_summary.md
  
...AND make sure all tests continue to run successfully.


## Bob's game

Now for a new feature:  an interactive display view for a Logical English program: a puzzle-solving like canvas surface where rules and facts (including one selected scenario) are represented by blocks, which a naive user can rearrange into a solution (proof tree). So in the example picture, 4 rules and 2 facts are represented on the left, a query on the top right, and an explanation of the solution (answer)  in the bottom right. In the picture blocks are colored and label-less, for pre-literate children, that will be a view mode;  but in another mode rather than color blocks we want blocks labeled LE literals (template instances). 
To recap, these are the UI elements :
- We invoke this new view in a separate window after selecting a scenario and query, and clicking a button "Proof Game", which will be near the Query and other existing buttons
- On the left a palette-like area with all rules of the program represented with head above and body conditions below, connected by arrows
- Another area on the left with program and scenario facts
- Top right, a block with the query
- In "pre-school" mode, literals are uniquely colored (tooltips showing the hidden LE literals); in "adult" mode, LE literals (template instances) appear

the user's goal is to drag and connect together enough rules and facts to support one answer to the query. the whole view is effectively, a manual proof builder/assistant.

Behind the scenes, we can use the explanations for the query answers to check whether the current proof is possible - or simply call our LE server to validate unification of literals. So the user proof has several states:
- still possible: compatible with some explanation
- impossible: some non matching rule head vs rule condition of parent above
- complete: provide some little animation to reward the user

It would be nice to have visual feedback when nodes match or not.

Use Rete.js (install it with npm) for the view UI in a first version, but keep things clean so we may move to React Flow or another library later.

Make an implementation plan... then execute it, I trust you!

### improvemments
- please improve the layout, nodes (for example for citizenship.le) are all together
- query node should display the actual LE query sentence, not its name
- Links betwen nodes should have arrows (body condition --> head)
- Ideally, if possible I would like lines between nodes to be alway vertical, as we want the proof to be built top down
- Add some zoom and panning controls
- When you select a node, highlight the corresponding source in the editor
  - add a button to rearrange nodes
- variables in rules should use the correct LE determiners
- when linking a head/fact to a rule body condition, we need to unify and propagate and retain the bindings in the whole tree fragment
- The PROOF game is not using negation as failure (NAF) in" Show Proof". For example in insureLE2/which_test2.le scenario 1 query 1 we need to consider that the failure of "the damage is caused by wear and tear or negligence" actually supports the proof. LEt's introduce a generic 'FAIL' node (stop sign in the children version) which can be connected to any node condition (and succeed IFF that condition has a "it is not the case that..." matching literal/template instance)


## Authentication
We now need to restrict web access to some example paths, with a minimal role-based system. We'll start with two access levels: anonymous users, and one user (support@logicalcontracts.com, initial password 'LE2rocks') with the 'insurLE2' role.

Things to do:
- (preliminary:) cleanup references to examples/moreExamples in the project. There should be only one reference, all other usage should refer to a single fact in le_kbs.pl
- Store user(Email, BcryptHash, Roles) in a Prolog fact file le_users.pl. Use library(crypto)'s crypto_password_hash/2 — never store plaintext or unsalted hashes.
- write predicate add_le_user(email,password,Roleslist) which adds to that file
- Create a file restricted_paths.pl with a predicate restricted_excel_for(Path,RolesList) where acess rights are stated. Initially has a single fact restricted_excel_for('examples/more/examples/insurLE2', [insurLE2]). ALL web endpoints must refuse access to files containing this path UNLESS the user is authenticated and has one of the indicated roles
- Review all web endpoints so they comply to the above restrictions. Go over docs/api.md for guidance. For now MCP endpoints should simply assume anonymous access
- is_allowed_export(..) remains unchanged, just an additional condition on processing the /source endpoint
- Add a minimal UI to our website, showing current logged-in user email or 'anonymous' in header, with a link to a simple form to authenticate, or alternatively link to logout 
- Setup Playwright tests: anonymous user should not see insureLE2/ examples in our home page; support@logicalcontracts.com user should

## Web extensions
Let's web serve some static resources that may extend LE, by HTTP serving all files under the existing directory /web_extensions/ (which is a sym link; no need to create it) 

## date tweaks
We need a new system template and builtin to test/generate a condition for two dates and a number. I already did put it in place, but the builtin is receiving date(...) terms instead of numbers/seconds. Can you fix this, so that the tests in dates.le work without errors? Currently I get this error thrown from my le_is_days_after/3 predicate:

ERROR: Arithmetic: `date/3' is not a function
ERROR: In:
ERROR:   [69] _84072 is 180*86400+date(2026,3,3)
ERROR:   [66] reasoner:solve_real_actual(le_is_days_after(_84142,180,date(2026,3,3)),'sff330352-5a70-11f1-a144-6763a902a272',m3a501f4e48a26c0911dd7757bcce70362a1c3531,[is_within_6_months_of(...,...),...],2,10,_84136,[success(...,_84184,_84186)]) at /Users/mc/git/LogicalEnglish2/reasoner.pl:177
...

## Sections
Let's now add a simple syntax to let a LE knowledge base (the rules part) be (optionally) split into sections:

    section MySection is:   

...meaning that all rules after this will belong to section MySection - until another "section S is:" instruction is found

We should add a complement to the le_source_element(RuleID, Designator, Goal) predicate , a new predicate le_source_section(SectionName, RuleID).

Some conventions will be followed:
- If there are no "section S is:" instructions, all rules belong to the default section 'main'
- All rules until the first "section S is:" instruction belong to section 'main'
- We need a specific syntactic construct to denote a frequently used section: "the annexes to the contract are:", which is shorthand for "section annexes is:", also accept the synonym "the annexes to the knowledge base are:"

Please implement parser changes, the new le_source_section/2 predicate, and extend example numbering_test.le to include a simple use and verification of "the annexes to the contract are:" construct.

## Not equals
In addition to recognizing "*a thing* is equal to *another thing*", already defined in le_system_template/1, we need to handle the opposite "*a thing* is not equal to *another thing*". 
And after that, please recognize also the synonym form "*a thing* is different from *another thing*".

## Prunning explanations
Running query 1, scenarion zero on insureLE2/hiscoxclaim1.le  has several problems:
- it gives a different result on the editor Query UI (failure), vs. the PROLOG command line (success), with goal "load('/Users/mc/git/LogicalEnglish2/examples/moreExamples/insureLE2/hiscoxclaim1.le',KB), createSession(KB, Session), queryScenario(Session, zero, 'we will make which payment under this policy in respect of this claim', TemplateInstance)."  
- The answers provided in the PROLOG command line are weird: rather than an instance of the query conjunction and(we_will_make(A), and(in_respect_of(A, 'this claim'), under(A, 'this policy'))), it provides fragments of it: [_A, in, respect, of, _A]; ['this claim', in, respect, of, 'this claim']; ...['this policy', under, 'this policy']
-  Perhaps some mixup caused by preprositional additions...?

- For the same example, scenario and query, query_explain(...) takes way too long to compute the negative explanation, and then returns a gigantic tree with MANY repeteated subtrees, see below. Let's avoid repeating  subtrees in the negative explanaitons, by detecting variants (to cater for different variables but similar patterns). When a subtree is repeated, the explanation rendering should display just its root node and a different colour and tooltip "Repeated sub-explanation")

we will make a payment
  it is not the case that we will not make a payment and a payment in respect of an incident and a payment under this policy
    we will not make a payment
      a payment under this policy
        a payment is under this policy

    a payment under this policy

        le_type_check(_14948,payment)
    
    Etc...


## Undefined predicates
Let's add an optional addition to a template, added via the ';' separator as usual: 'undefined' (accept also synonym "scenario element"). The only effects of this addition are on verification. If a template is declared undefined:
- do not warn  about its undefined predicate
- do warn if there is a template fact or rule head in the program 

## Buggy forall

In the example program below, query 1 for scenario one should succeed (because forall(false,anything) succeeds), instead in the UI we see "Error: Operation failed or internal error", and the Prolog log has this:

% Setting scenario by name: one
ERROR: [Thread httpd@3050_7] '$set_predicate_attribute'/3: No permission to modify static procedure `true/0'

The example program:

the templates are:
    true.
    false.
    test. 

the knowledge base includes:

test if 
    for all cases in which
        false
        it  is the case that
        false. 

scenario one is: 
    true.

query 1 is: 
    test. 

### Negative explanation please

Still in forall_vacuous.le: the explanation for the answer to query one, scenarion one needs to be improved. It is currently:

test
  for all cases in which false
    it is the case that
      false

(all green nodes, as if all had succeeded)

We need two changes:
- split the Condition in "for all cases in which Condition" into a child node
- If it has failed, as is the case in this scenario, it should be a negative explanation, ergo red

so the explanation should be instead:

test
  for all cases in which
    false  % this node should be red
    it is the case that
      false

## Rules in scenarios
Scenarios need to be able to have rules too, not just facts. For example, in line 34 of examples/moreExamples/subset.le that rule is part of scenario lists.

## Problems with unless
query one with scenario exclusion in examples/moreExamples/insureLE2/hiscoxexcludingexclusion.le is producing an incomplete explanation:

we will make a payment
  it is not the case that we will not make a payment
    we will not make a payment (RED NODE, failing)

The last node should have some more nodes under it, namely "...in respect of...", the first (prepositional originated) condition in the body of the rule in line 28

Great, the explanation is much better. But now another problem: 
query one for scenario exclusion should actually fail! Notice that 'we will not make a payment' succeeds (even if with 2 unknown literals assumed true), therefore its parent node 'it is not the case that we will not make a payment' must fail. Cf. explanation, all nodes green/succeeded except where indicated:

we will make a payment
  it is not the case that we will not make a payment
    we will not make a payment
      a payment in respect of this claim % ASSUMED
      a payment under this policy % ASSUMED
      this claim or part of this claim or loss is directly or indirectly due to any act breach or omission you deliberately or recklessly commit , condone or ignore
      it is not the case that a payment and this claim are admissible by the laws of the United Kingdom in relation to compulsory employers ` liability insurance
        a payment and this claim are admissible by the laws of the United Kingdom in relation to compulsory employers ` liability insurance % FAILED

## lack of type checking
Now for a a problem with type checking. In example examples/moreExamples/insureLE2/TEMP_hiscoxhappypathcurrency.le, query 1 for scenario zero produces too many answers. Looking at their explanations, I diagnosed one of the reasons for this to be that both the rules in line 139,

    a payment in respect of a claim 
        if the payment is in respect of the claim.

and the rule in line 151,

    an amount in respect of a claim 
        if the amount is in respect of the claim.

match the scenario fact in line 264:

    this payment is in respect of this claim.

BUT only the first rule should match, because of argument types: 'this payment' is a payment, therefore it should be rejected by the typechecking vs type 'amount' in the second rule

### Opus 4.8 response
Your diagnosis was right: both in_respect_of annex rules (payment-typed and amount-typed) matched the scenario fact this payment is in respect of this claim, because the generated clauses carried no type information. Two changes make type-checking discriminate:

1. Instance-aware type checking (reasoner.pl)

The type checks (le_type_check, check_args_compatibility) previously only constrained arguments that were themselves types (le_type(AA)), never instances. They also only looked in the KB module, but scenario is_a facts (like this payment is a payment) live in the session. New helper type_arg_ok/4:
- accepts any and universal types (thing/object/entity/…);
- for a type value, requires sub-typing only when the formal type is grounded (preserves the earlier *sub* isa *super* fix);
- for an instance with a known type (an is_a fact in session or KB), requires it to actually be of the formal type — so a payment is rejected for an amount slot;
- otherwise accepts.

2. Per-rule head type checks at ambiguous positions (le_grammar.pl)

Each KB rule clause now gets le_type_check goals on its head variables (typed by the variable's own name) — but only at argument positions where the functor's templates disagree on the type. So in_respect_of/2 (arg 1 is payment in one template, amount in another) gets checked and the rules become … :- le_type_check(A, payment/amount), …; a single-template role like affiliate does not, so a company acting as an affiliate is still accepted.

The goal-level check_args_compatibility was kept lenient (type-values only, via type_value_ok) — instance discrimination happens solely through the gated head checks. That distinction is exactly what fixed the regression I first hit (4_affiliates_3 rejecting his_company as an affiliate).

Net result: in_respect_of(this_payment, this_claim) now matches only the payment rule.

Note: query 1 still returns 2 answers — you said the in_respect_of clash was one of the reasons for over-answering, so there may be other causes left to chase; this fix removes the one you diagnosed. Want me to dig into what's behind the remaining two?


Why query 1 had 2 answers (diagnosis)

Both answers are identical — same instance (we will make this payment) and same unknowns ([]). They come from two distinct proofs of the same answer: the annex rule

all claims and losses … will be regarded as parts of a single claim if
    … arise from the same original cause or source of the single claim
    or … arise from a repeated or continuing series of events for the single claim.

has an or, and in scenario zero both branches hold (each is a for all cases … that's vacuously true — there are no matching losses). So …fulfils all the general conditions… is proved two ways, yielding the same we will make this payment twice. This is correct reasoning, just redundant in the answer list.

Fix 1 — deduplicate answers (classic_web_api.pl)

run_answering_query/4 now collects answers keyed by (answer string + unknowns) and keeps the first proof of each via dedup_keep_first/2. So identical answers are listed once; answers that genuinely differ (different bindings or different unknowns) are preserved. (The test harness already deduped via sort, which is why the suite was unaffected.) → query 1 now returns 1 answer.

Fix 2 — render le_type_check nicely (le_kbs.pl)

Added an item_to_instance/3 case so a le_type_check(Arg, Type) node renders like the type assertion it checks, with a/an agreement:
- le_type_check('this payment', payment) → "this payment is a payment"
- le_type_check(X, amount) → "X is an amount"


Done. handle_explain/2 now applies the same answer deduplication as run_answering_query/4:

- It collects (answer string + unknowns)-JSONWhy pairs and runs them through the shared dedup_keep_first/2, so repeated proofs of the same answer yield a single explanation rather than one per proof path.
- Distinct answers (different bindings or different unknowns) are still all returned.

## Prunning positive explanations
First, an issue: "Copy Explanation" is copying just the clicked subtree, but it should copy the whole explanatin tree. For example insureLE2/testing/hiscoxhappypath.le, scenario zero, query 1, I am only able to copy the subtree rooted in "we will make this payment", missing the other two sibling subtrees

Second, an improvement: similarly as for negative explanations, let's please detect repeated subtrees in positive explanations. For the same LE program, for example the subtree rooted in "this payment in respect of this claim" is repeated; please render the repeated instances as you do with failed subtree repetitions (but omit the counting)

## Misguided negative explanation
Now for a problem navigating from negative explanations to source. In example insureLE2/testing/hiscoxhappypath2.le, query 1 on scenario zero fails with this explanation (all red nodes, prefix "it is not true that:"):

it is not true that: we will make a payment
  it is not true that: fractured wrist and soft-tissue injuries occurs during a period
  it is not true that: a claim against a person
    it is not true that: a claim is against a person

When I click "fractured wrist and soft-tissue injuries occurs during a period", it navigates correctly to line 101. BUT when i click  the first "a claim against a person" it navigates to line 148.
I would like it to navigate instead to the goal call at line 100

ok, let's make negative explanations more detailed, and try to keep track of  rule failures (when one rule fails and the interpreter backtracks to try the next rule). So in addition to storing called(...) facts, the interpreter should store called_clause(...), when starting to interpret a rule body. Then we want the negative explanation to have intermediate "failed rule" nodes under a failed predicate, with the rule names, and each rule's subgoal failures under it as children. The explanation rendering should allow navigation from these new nodes to the rule as a whole.
Also, when a predicate has only one rule don't bother to create the failed rule node.
This change may be computationally expensive, so let's have an explanation preference (stored in browser localStorage and in a LE session fact) to enable it (off by default, e.g. no failed rule nodes).

## Query timeouts
We need to deal with slow queries. In particular for failures and big negative explanation trees the user may be in for a long wait. So let's make UI queries interruptable by the user, with an interrupt button in the UI that appears after 2 seconds of waiting.

## Configurable explanation repetitions
We currently remove repeated subtrees from both positive (success) and negative (failures) explanations. Make this a preference for the user, persisting on LocalStorage; initial default "Hide repeated explanations"

## Meta-level proposition bugs
Meta variables in events are (1) always last and (2) preceded by 'that'. In example examples/moreExamples/tea_party.le the rule at line 13:

it is prohibited that a creature attends a tea party if 
	it is not the case that
	it is approved that the creature attends the tea party.

should NOT have the following PROLOG equivalent:

it_is_prohibited_that(_) :-
    and(le_at(not(true), 374, 397), le_at(it_is_approved_that(_), 399, 453)).

This should be instead something like (ommiting precise char ranges):

it_is_prohibited_that(attends(A,B)) :-
   le_at(not(le_at(it_is_approved_that(attends(A,B)), ..., ...)), ..., ...).


Another bug parsing  rules with "that". The following rule in examples/moreExamples/testing/tea_party2.le:

it is prohibited that a creature attends the tea party if
   the creature is a lofty creature
	and it is not the case that
it is approved that the creature attends the tea party.

, which has a weird indentation (but which we wish to tolerate) has this PROLOG equivalent:

it_is_prohibited_that(attends(A, B)) :-
    and(le_at(and(is_a_lofty_creature(A), le_at(not(true), 1327, 1350)),
              1289,
              1321),
        le_at(it_is_approved_that(attends(A, B)), 1351, 1405)).

This is incorrect, not(true) makes no sense. The parsing should be:

it_is_prohibited_that(attends(A, B)) :-
    le_at(and(is_a_lofty_creature(A),
              le_at(not(le_at(it_is_approved_that(attends(A, B)),
                              ...,
                              ...)),
                    ...,
                    ...)),
          ...,
          ...).

## Weird colouring of templates
In examples/moreExamples/AItest.le , "the  templates are:" is not properly coloured; notice that there is an extra space after "the". Also the templates in the following lines are coloured incorrectly, emphasizing words like "there", "are" etc. which are just elements of the templates. 
If we remove that extra space, all colouring becomes correct! Please fix this; extra spaces in section headers are admissible

## Bob's Book
### Survey
Read docs/RK_book/CLandHT-HtobAI.pdf , a book that preceded and inspired Logical English. It contains a number of illustrative examples written in a "pre LE" dialect, sometimes with connectives and primitives which are not in LE yet. We want to collect all those examples into a new document docs/RK_book/bookExamples.md ,  containing:
- titles for all chapters and their subsections from the book
- for each subsection, all its examples if any:  a short summary of the motivation, and the actual sentences/rules of the example

As you do this, add short comments on whether the example is "complete", or just a fragment complementing the text; and also whether it fits already into current LE

In a later step we'll convert most of the examples to LE... but not yet

please number the sections for each chapter N, e.g. N.1, N.2 etc   

#### Opus 4.8 response
  What was produced

  A structured survey covering every chapter and subsection of Kowalski's Computational Logic and Human Thinking:

  - Front matter (Preface, Contents, Summary/Plan, Introduction)
  - Chapters 1–17 and the Conclusions
  - Appendices A1–A6 (the technical chapters — note A6 The Logic of Abductive Logic Programming wasn't in the original heading outline; a reading
  agent found it) and the References

  Each subsection lists its examples, and every example has:
  - a one/two-line Motivation,
  - the actual sentences/rules transcribed close to verbatim in code blocks,
  - a Status line judging (a) complete vs fragment and (b) fits current LE / partially / not yet — naming the missing construct.
  
  Relevant figures are embedded (connection graphs, search trees, semantic networks, decision/event diagrams, the wise-men graph, resolution figures)
  via CLandHT-HtobAI_conversion/chunk-0-img-N.jpeg; decorative images were skipped.

  Verification
  
  - All 27 top-level headings present (Front Matter → References).
  - All referenced images resolve to existing files.
  - No leftover agent/scratch artifacts (the grep hits are genuine example lines like "I have the cheese").

  How the LE-fit judgments broke down (useful for the later conversion step)

  - Already fit LE: Ch6 citizenship & lease rules (maps to the existing citizenship.le), Ch5 negation-as-failure / rules-and-exceptions, Ch3
  fox-and-crow beliefs, Ch12 trolley beliefs, many A1 definite-clause examples.
  - Partially / abduction: Ch10 wet-grass and open-predicate examples map to LE's unknown/assumable; Ch17 "believes that…" maps to says/that.
  - Not yet: maintenance goals & the agent cycle (Ch1, 7, 8, 9), event/situation calculus (Ch13, parts of 6), integrity constraints … then false
  (throughout), decision-theoretic utilities (Ch11), biconditionals-as-equivalences (Ch15), and resolution/connection-graph machinery (A5).

### LE examples
Read docs/RK_book/bookExamples.md and vibe code into Logical English all the examples that you deemed "Already fit LE"; for now into directory docs/RK_book/examples . For each candidate example, you need to follow a flow similar to the LE Assistant (light mode):
- follow the instructions in AGENTS_LE_template.md , DISCARDING the DEEP_MODE_ONLY_START section - you cannot use MCP
- at the end of each example draft do NOT run the full test suite; instead you should verify the example calling le_tool_verify/2; and iterate generate/verify up to about 20 attempts. Use also le_tool_query/2 as needed 
- At the top of each LE file created, place a comment with: Chapter/subsection origin; and whether the last verification flagged open issues with the program
  
#### Opus 4.8 response
● Done. I vibe-coded 22 Logical English programs into docs/RK_book/examples/, one for each substantive book example that bookExamples.md judged
  "Already fit LE", following the LE-Assistant light-mode flow (draft → le_tool_verify/2 → fix, iterating with le_tool_query/2, never the full suite,
  no git commit).

  What was built

  I first identified every "Fits current LE" status line in bookExamples.md (filtering out the "partially"/"not yet" ones), then hand-built and
  verified a reference example (fox_and_crow.le) to discover the LE gotchas, and fanned the remaining ~19 across parallel subagents — each given the
  exact book text, an in-process verify/query harness, and the gotchas. I then independently re-verified all 22 files myself:
  
  - 22/22 pass with no failing tests. 21 are fully clean (ISSUES: none); only grass_wet_abduction.le carries two inherent rule_without_variables
  warnings (the book's wet-grass beliefs are genuinely propositional) — documented honestly in its header.
  - Every file has the required header: chapter/section origin + whether the last verification flagged open issues.
  - Coverage spans Ch.1 (Underground notice), Ch.3 (fox & crow, above transitivity), Ch.4 (party loop), Ch.5 (last train, naf + defeat, older-brother
  CWA, innocent-until-guilty, suppression task, housing benefit, layered thief exceptions), Ch.6 (BNA citizenship, relative clauses, naturalisation,
  lease termination), Ch.7 (Genesis ancestors, equation-solving goal), Ch.10 (wet-grass abduction via ; unknown), Ch.11 (cause/effect), Ch.12 (trolley
  problem), Ch.14 (behaviourist fox), and Appendix A1 (amazing animals + taxonomy).
  
  A README.md maps each file to its origin and documents the handful of "fits LE" entries that were folded into other files or skipped (abstract
  schemas, bare-fact context illustrations, verbatim duplicates).

  Notable LE findings surfaced during the work

  - Concrete entities must be bare constants (crow, not the crow, which parses as a variable).
  - Distinct same-type variables need qualifier names (a first person/a second person).
  - Inline it is not the case that … mis-parses; the negated sentence must sit on its own indented line.
  - Mutual recursion among head predicates can block enumeration under open queries (split holds vs has).
  - _ is killed / _ is distracted collide with system templates (renamed to is destroyed / has been distracted).

## forall explanations
Now we need an improvement of forall(...) explanations. In examples/moreExamples/subset.le, query subset on scenario facts has second answer "family two is a subset of family one", which is correct, but it has this explanation:

family two is a subset of family one
  family two is a set
  family one is a set
  for all cases in which
    Alice belongs to family two
    it is the case that
      a thing belongs to family one

...which mixes a specific condition (Alice belongs to family two) with a more general statement (a thing belongs to family one). This is confusing. We would like to have instead something like:

family two is a subset of family one
  family two is a set
  family one is a set
  for all cases in which a thing belongs to family two
    for case Alice belongs to family two
    it is true that Alice belongs to family one
    % for some other case...
    % it is true that ... some other second conditiom
    % etc
      
In this example there is only one case (Alice), but other forall constructs may have several cases, originating more 'for..'/'it is true that..' pairs (which of course may have subtrees), as shown in comments above

## quotes in templates
We need to allow single quotes in templates, as in "the limit of indemnity for employers' liability is *an amount*". Tolerate only a single occurrence per template (or template instance), as multiple occurrences would be ambiguous versus string constants. Come up with a simple example for testing and implement this.

## Debugging proof game with negative explanation
In examples/moreExamples/happy_dragon.le, scenario smoky, query happy, the second answer has an explanation that includes a multilevel failure subtree (annotated with "FAILURE: " below). But there is no solution in the "Proof Game", and there should be. 
Looking closer, I see that the Proof Game has "FAIL" leaf nodes, to represent leaf failures, but seems to miss two things: 
- negation links (to connect the head of rule in line 13 with the last condition in the rule in line 18); perhaps with "not the case" labels 
- a way to link to the two sub-conditions in "for all cases in which ...", in the rule in line 23.


alice is happy
  alice is a dragon
  for all cases in which alice is a parent of a dragon
    for case alice is a parent of bob
    it is true that bob is healthy
      bob is a dragon
      it is not the case that bob smokes
        FAILURE: it is not true that: bob smokes
          FAILURE: it is not true that: alice smokes
            FAILURE: it is not true that: a creature is a parent of alice

Please wire Show-proof to auto-build forall/negation links. Also, when linking the head of rule in line 13 to rule in line 18, the link should
  have a "not the case" label. And one more thing: when rule 23 is connected from "alice is a dragon", the forall condition is not showing the
  binding (of 'the creature' to 'alice')

Let's revisit our "negation link" answer to your question above: we need to go all the way and turn the whole subtree into "failing mode". Otherwise in this example the user cannot construct the full failure tree under "bob smokes". The full explanation needs to be our proof game solution spine. This principle also applies to "Show Proof", it needs to connect based on the actual explanation rather than guess condition matches.

## missing failures in explanation
Some failure nodes are missing. Consider the explanation for the second answer of examples/moreExamples/happy_dragon.le, scenario smoky, query happy. Seem my notes below:

alice is happy
  alice is a dragon
  for all cases in which alice is a parent of a dragon
    for case alice is a parent of bob
    it is true that bob is healthy
      bob is a dragon
      it is not the case that bob smokes
        it is not true that: bob smokes
          THIS IS MISSING: an other creature is a parent of bob
          THIS IS CORRECTLY NOT IN THE EXPLANATION: alice is a dragon
          it is not true that: alice smokes
            it is not true that: a creature is a parent of alice

THIS IS MISSING: first condition of the smokes rule; although a solution was produced,  the call was not ground, so theyre may be missing solutions explaining the faiure
THIS IS CORRECTLY NOT IN THE EXPLANATION: one solution produced, but call was already ground (its solutions are irrelevant)

Please fix the explanation trees, and check that the Proof Game reflects the fix

finally, pleaase fix the Typescript warnings

## Preselect scenario and query
Let the editor process two additional optional query string parameteres, which assume that 'example' or 'text' are also present:
- scenario: selects the indicated scenario
- query: selects the indicated query
The query is NOT to be executed, the user should press its button for that.
If there are syntactic errors or other serious condition (such as nonexisting query etc), present a short modal dialog to the user with the error
Finally, when the user selects a scenario or query with the menus, alter the URL so that the user can copy a full URL with the selected scenario and/or query
Oh, and also add an 'answer' parameter, same principles, but with the ORDER of an answer (requires query and scenario); this actually executes the selected query  and selects the answer so the user can see its explanation etc

## More Proof Game bugs
Two new issues with the Proof Game:
- In examples/moreExamples/happy_dragon.le, scenario smoky, query happy, the first condition in the smokes rule (at line 14) is not being bound properly, as can be seen with "Show Proof". For example in node for rule head instance "bob smokes", the first condition shown in the node is "a creature is a parent of the dragon", whereas it should be "a creature is a parent of bob"
- In the same example, an user was able to construct an incorrect "solution" (e.g. the system paints it all green) manually with only 4 nodes, as shown in the picture. I could not reproduce this myself, so  the user probably did other intermediate edits which somehow messed up the "correct proof detection" logic, that needs to be more robust
  
### missing bindings
In happy_dragon.le / query healthy, second answer "alice is happy", the "Show Proof" solution still lacks some bindings,
  namely in the rule with head "bob smokes": all 3 conditions should mention alice, since we have "alice smokes" in the thrid
  condition. We must reflect the effect of unification.
  As a matter of fact, the explanation tree seems to have the same problem:

alice is happy
  alice is a dragon
  for all cases in which alice is a parent of a dragon
    for case alice is a parent of bob
    it is true that bob is healthy
      bob is a dragon
      it is not the case that bob smokes
        x bob smokes
          a creature is a parent of bob %% THIS SHOULD BE "alice is a parent of bob"
          x alice smokes
            x a creature is a parent of alice

This may imply keeping solution bindings even for goals that eventually failed, like "a creature is a parent of bob"

### Multiple attacks to negation
In example examples/moreExamples/testing/p_with_negation.le , the failure of r requires the failure of both u and w. So the correct proof solution should have two links from "it is not the case that r", one to rule "r if u", the other to rule "r if w". Because the success of either of these would "attack" the NAF conclusion "it is not the case that r". In other words, a "it is not the case that X" condition in a node can admit multiple links to rules, all with matching head X

### forall with multiple cases
In example examples/moreExamples/testing/happpy_dragon.le , scenario mary, query happy, the Proof Game for answer 2 is wrong. The explanation is correct:

alice is happy
  alice is a dragon
  for all cases in which alice is a parent of a dragon
    for case alice is a parent of bob
    it is true that bob is healthy
    for case alice is a parent of mary
    it is true that mary is healthy

...BUT the proof game solution is not showing the second case ("alice is a parent of mary", ...). All cases must be shown. 
  
## Multilingual

We need to support alternative hindo european languages, such as Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, ..., so that Logical English can be used also as (say) "Português Lógico", "Español Lógico", etc. Please evaluate difficulties and draft an implementation plan docs/MultilingualLEplan.md - no coding yet - considering the following:
- A Le program file will use only one language, determined at the very start by the first statement, for example "a linguagem alvo é: prolog" for PT, "the target language is: prolog" for EN, etc.
- All LE keywords, determiners recognised in templates, system templates, error messages (some of them possibly format/3 templates) need multilanguage versions; hopefully we will not need alternative DCG rules per language, not sure
- LE Assistant prompts need to be tuned and various to generate the desired language 
- All UI strings need to be multilingual, assuming the English strings as canonical keys: editor and query panel, tooltips, source calls graph, proof game, Trace. These should render accordingly to a new language selector in the UI
- Monaco tables need to be multilingual too; it may be a good time for some refactoring to avoid duplicating strings in the Prolog backend and editor Typescript...?
- System Multilingual strings should be all together in one or more file dictionaries per language, as JSON or preferably .csv files (to facilitate later editing/tweaking by human translators);  we should draft a first stab of all translations using our own agent LLM
- LE examples should also be translated into all supported languages, perhaps either using a simple file naming convention like MyExample.le, MyExample.pt.le, MyExample.en.le etc; or use example su-directories per language

Again, for now produce just the implementation plan with design issues to be resolved if any; no coding yet.

## Home page cleanup
Our home page is growing with many examples, so please make the example folders (sub dirs) collapsable/expandable, and remember the expanded/collapsed state in LocalStorage. Also provide a way to open the page fully expanded, perhaps with an optional query string param

## Scenario colouring
In example examples/moreExamples/insureLE2/testing/hiscoxclaim1.le some facts are not correctly coloured. For example in line 308 only "the individual" should be coloured as LE Variable/Argument - NOT "working"

## Repeated explanations
In example examples/testing/hiscoxclaim1.le scenario zero, query 1, we have a big  explanation (failure) tree, a good case for "Hide repeated explanations". Now, each node shown as a proxy for its repetitions needs to let the user navigate to the actual instance of the node that has its full subtree ; so please add a contextual menu item to these nodes which lets the user navigate to / select the node with expanded subtree (in other words, the original explanation node that was repeated)

## Scenario editor
We need a separate window to create and edit scenarios for the current LE program, invokable from a new "Edit" menu item. Each scenario should be editable via a vertical sequence of "editable templates", constructed as follows. For a LE template (say) "*a person* is born in *a place* on *a date*", the UI should consist in a row with labels and fields:
    <a person field> is born in <a place field> on <a date field>
Each field should have hint text with the variable in the LE template (for example "a person", etc)
At the top of this window we should have a menu picker for declared scenarios in the Le program (picking one loads that scenario into this windos), plus an entry for "New". At the bottom two buttons: "Copy" (to the clipboard) and "Insert into Editor" (replaces selected scenario with the new version, or appends to the end of scenarios). Attempting to close the window prior to copying to clipboard or inserting change into the editor should warn (ask for confirmation to) the user

This is mostly a client UI implementation, final LE syntax check (after editor update/insertion) always happens at the Prolog side

### Tweaks
A few changes please:
- In each line we do NOT want the full template instance to be editable, only the placeholders; so for eample in "John is born in the UK on 2021-10-09" (citizenship example), there should be 3 fields and 2 intermediate labels ("is born in", "on") :  *a person* is born in *a place* on *a date*
- At the botto in the "Add fact" menu: no "(free text)" option; this is strictly templateç-driven
- No need for a theme picker; we simply use what the editor has determined

Clicking "Insert into Editor" should close the window. no need for the "move up" / "move down" arrow buttons

The "Add a fact" menu should contain only the following templates:
- those declared as (propositional) "undefined"
- those currently used in some scenario
other templates should NOT be in the menu

## Unknowns bindings
If a query answer has associated unknown goals (non empty list in third argument of explain/4 or i/4), these should be rendered in a tooltip in the answer, as template instances.

## Scenario Variations
New feature: a new window "Scenario Variations", which will allow the user to pick a scenario, alter it and instantly run one or more queries on it. It will be invoked by an additional button "Variations", between "Query" and "Trace", and open in a new window tab. 
The Scenario Variations window will consider the invocation URL to obtain optional parameters (see below), and will have the following elements, top to bottom, reusing existing components whenever possible:
- Title "Scenario variations for <KB_NAME>"
- A scenario picker, identical to the one in the Query panel; preselected with the scenario that was selected in the Query Panel (if any)
- A component identical to the body of the existing Scenario Editor, so the user can alter or add facts; no "Insert into Editor" button, but there should be a "Copy Scenario" (copies the scenario text to clipboard)
- A sequence of zero or more queries; there should be a "Add Query" button allowing the user to pick one of the queries defined in the program; like scenario facts, queries should have a remove button (close box)
-  Under each query header, expression(name), a component identical to the body of the existent Query panel: a list of answers (unknown tooltips included) side by side with the explanation of the selected answer, navigating to the editor source code
-  A Query button, which executes ALL queries in the above list; it will be disabled after query execution, and be re-enabled only when the user edits something (query list, scenarion fact)

As the user edits the query list or the selected scenario, the URL is to change to include the changes, so the user can share what he's doing (just like with the editor) with other users; so there should be a query string param "scenarioText" to cater for scenario variations, a queries param etc

Each scenario fact should have a checkbox "Assume" to its right (tooltip "if checked, fact is assumed, unknown"); while checked, the fact fields are no longer editable, and the fact scenario sent to the server should be preceded by "it is unknown whether". If the LE program defines the scenario fact unknown, the checkbox should be checked (and the user can uncheck it). 

## Strongest explanation
We now want to give the user the "strongest reason" supporting an answer, a kind of terse explanation summary. For this we'll use an heuristic based on tree weights of the explanation tree (with repetitions removed if the user so preferred), as follows:
- for an explanation subtree, success or failure, its weight is 1 + sum of weights of children; in other words, weight = descendent node count
- consider the explanation tree's full weight W. The "strongest reason" is the node whose weight is closer to W/2
The strongest reason is to be determnined on the Prolog side, and will appear only as a tooltip over the "EXPLANATION" explanation title

rule nodes are to have intrinsic weight only when the rule has an explicit name; otherwise rule nodes are to be "transparent" for determination of the strongest reason. 
failed nodes, if chosen as strongest reason, should be rendered with the prefix "it is not the case that "; try to do this reusing existing code if possible, to avoid pasting that string all over our code
When a failed node is a NAF (ergo has the form "it is not the case that X"), instead of adding another duplicated prefix... remove it! The node should be rendered simply as "X" (for strongest reason; no changes to the tree rendering)

Add to the "EXPLANATION" title a contextual menu item "Show strongest reason", which expands the explanation tree and selects the "strongest explanation" node (and expands it one level)

Sorry but let's rename "Strongest Reason" to "Important reason". And "Variations" to "Scenario Variations". And add descriptive tooltips to this button, as well as to "Proof Game"

## Explanation drill
Let's now implement a new nonmodal window, "Explanation Drill", invoked from a contextual menu item on the "EXPLANATION" title, where the user will answer a sequence of simple yes/no questions to help him find an interesting, fulfilling reason for the answer, and also to help him understand the explanation. 
This dialog is based on the explanation tree (ignoring some nodes as indicated above for the weights determination), considered as a "suspects tree" (more on this later) and goes on like this:

1) start with the explanation tree root as the top suspect TOP, and an empty list of UNDERSTOOD nodes; these mean subtrees "virtually removed" from the TOP tree. Remember the INITIAL_NOT_UNDERSTOOD_YET_NODES_COUNT, which is the weight of TOP.
2) find the strongest reason node S in the subtree for TOP, as done above, BUT ignoring all subtrees of nodes in UNDERSTOOD; render it and follow it by the question "Understood ?", with buttons for "Yes" and "Not yet"
2.1) if the user answers "Yes", add S to UNDERSTOOD, and continue at step 2
2.2) if the user answers "Not yet", set TOP to S, and continue at step 2
3) If S==TOP, add neither node nor question, just highlight the question for node TOP, and a final message "Nothing else to show. Feel free to alter your choices above"

The Yes/Not Yet buttons should retain state, meaning for each question there are 3 possible exclusive answers: no answer at all; Yes pressed; or "Not Yet" pressed.
If the user changes a previous answer, alter UNDERSTOOD and/or TOP, and continue at 2; so the user may be questioned about more nodes

TOP and UNDERSTOOD should be kept in the LE session on the Prolog side, INITIAL_NOT_UNDERSTOOD_YET_NODES_COUNT probably on the window.

As each question is added to the window, corresponding to a node in the explanation tree being questioned about, select the source code in the editor (but keeping the focus on the Drill window). 

Also display some cute progress bar at the top, sized to INITIAL_NOT_UNDERSTOOD_YET_NODES_COUNT. As user answers comes in, sum the tree weights of all UNDERSTOOD nodes, and that's the progress to render in the bar.

Add some close boxes to the answers (meaning, delete); when deleting an answer, keep the other answers and recompute a next question, but only if the user has answered all questions left. In the progress bar remove the counts, which may confuse the user; just put a single label... "Progress"; no percentage either
One more thing: add a title/message above the drill questions and below the progress bar: "Understanding why <explanation tree root>:"

In the citizenship.le example, scenario trust_harry query one, the "important reason" is wrong; it should be "Harry is the father of John", not a leaf node. When computing the "middle node" dividing tree weights rounding should be towards weighter nodes, not leaves

### Bug fixes
In the Explanation Drill, please use "Accept?" instead of "Understood?". 
Also make sure the Drill window is using its own LE session, as an user complained about an expired session.
And please make sure questions are not repeated; the TOP node has an implict "Not yet" answer.
If the user clicks on a card for a question in the Explanation Drill, select its source code in the editor

## Synonyms
Now for a new template addition, 'synonym', wich lets a template indicate one more equivalent forms. For example:

*a payment* in respect of *a claim*; synonym *a payment* is in respect of *a claim*.

This means that the same PROLOG literal may be mappable to from several templates. The "first" (non synonymous) template determines the literal name.
Whenever it is necessary to obtain a template instance from a PROLOG literal:
- if we have source code location, if possible use the template alternative in the source
- else use the first (non synonym) template

To simplify things, a template with a synonym cannot have other additions (except synonym).
Implement this and create a simple example moreExamples/synonyms.le with expected answers

### Reaction to reviewer comments
Following are some comments to docs/tutorial0/IntroToLE2.md by a senior reviewer; quotes from the tutorial are indented, his comments not.
Improve the document accordingly.

    Negation    LE does negation‑as‑failure with it is not the case that.
    The negated goal goes on its own indented line beneath it:

	it is prohibited that a creature attends a tea party if
		it is not the case that
		it is approved that the creature attends the tea party

This would be a good place to explain the use of 'that' for propositional attitudes, in relation to the templates.

    Load happy_dragon. It's short but introduces two ideas: negation feeding into a conclusion,

Not quite right. Negation feeding into a conclusion was introduced in the previous section.

    and universal quantification.

Better perhaps call this "'forall' conditions".

    The program also shows off meta‑templates — sentences that take other sentences as arguments:

This can be moved forward to the prohibited, tea party example, and perhaps mentioned again here.

Missing the promised explanation of 'assumables'.

## Folding prepositional additions
The answer to query 1 scenario zero in examples/moreExamples/insureLE2/testing/hiscoxhappypath.le, shown in the Query panel as "true and we will make this payment and this payment in respect of this claim and this payment under this policy", reveals the need for a couple fixes and an improvement on the Prolog side, in this order:
1) The initial 'true and ' is redundant
2) "we will make this payment under this policy in respect of this claim" is the head of the rule at line 99, whose PROLOG equivalent starts with: "we_will_make(A) :-and(le_at(in_respect_of(A, B), 7986, 8007),and(le_at(under(A, 'this policy'), 7968, 7985),..." ; in_respect_of(..) and under(...) should switch positions, to reflect the textual ordering of the corresponding templates 
3) "we will make this payment and this payment in respect of this claim and this payment under this policy" is the "unfolded" (via prepositional templates) of "we will make this payment under this policy in respect of this claim"; users prefer seeing this more compact form. Suggestion: add some answer pre-rendering postprocessing to detect patterns of consecutive prepositional templates; perhaps use the DCG in reverse..?? Just a wild thought.

explanations are fine as they are
Ooops... actually explanation nodes that use this "unfolded" form should be folded too; the tree structure remains intact,
  that's what I meant

### Opus 4.8 response
Root insight: the answer (from Items) and the explanation (from solving Goal) render independently. Both flow through item_to_instance/3, so a single rendering fix there fixes the answer and the explanation nodes — without changing tree structure, exactly as you clarified.

Issues 1 & 3 — drop true and, and fold prepositional chains (le_kbs.pl):
Added fold_prep_chain/3 (+ helpers) and wired it into item_to_instance's and/2 branch. When a goal is a main literal conjoined with prepositional-template goals sharing its subject, it re-folds into the compact sentence and drops true conjuncts. So the answer went from
true and we will make this payment and this payment in respect of this claim and this payment under this policy
to
we will make this payment under this policy in respect of this claim.
The same folding applies to explanation nodes (e.g. the it is not the case that we will not make… node), tree structure untouched.

The phrases are ordered by their le_at source positions, so the folded text is always in the order the user wrote them.

(One subtle bug fixed along the way: detecting a prepositional template must compare the Prep field with ==, not unify it — unifying binds the unbound Prep slot of non-prepositional templates and matches everything.)

Issue 2 — compiled rule-head ordering (le_grammar.pl):
Prepositional chain goals are collected reverse-textual. Added order_extra_goals_by_source/2, applied where a rule head's / query's extra goals are folded into the body, to sort them by source position when they all carry ranges (left untouched when defines global goals are present). The rule at line 99 now compiles as we_will_make(A) :- under(A,…) and in_respect_of(A,…) and …, and the explanation shows under this policy before in respect of this claim.

Tests: added testing/test_prep_fold.pl (compact-folded answer; rule-head textual order). Full suite green — unit + LE examples + 42 e2e. Nothing committed.

Your two mid-flight notes are both honored: explanations keep their structure, and the previously-unfolded explanation nodes now fold too.

## Large queries
Large queries mess with the Query panel UI. Sometimes the query picker menu becomes so wide that the buttons may be pushed off screen. Truncate queries in the menu to a maximum of 70 chars, suffix "...(QueryNumber)", and show the full query as a tooltip

## Trace
The "Trace" experience in window "LE Debugger" is not good enough:
- Source highlighting is CALLincorrect many times
- Let's show the call stack top-bottom, in the spirit for top down LE/Prolog execution
- "VARIABLES" seems useless as it is: vara appear always unbound, and then disappear; insetad we want the VARIABLES column to show the vars of the call on the same line, over time. So for example a top call var may be bound as a result of some call several levels deep stepping (and all vars in calls in between of course), reflecting unification
- "for all cases in which" calls disappear while their condition and consequent execute, confusing the user
- Apparently only the first answer is traceable
- Add more ellaborate tooltips to the buttons

## Paper appendix
docs/papers/LE2paperDraft.md was written before a number of system improvements. Write a docs/papers/LE2paperAppendix.md  describing major LE features added since the paper was written.

I think some of the items in docs/papers/LE2paperAppendix.md are proprietary (if they depend on code in le_extensions.pl). Just add a "not in open source version" warning to those

## Patching scenario variations
In Scenario Variations, in red (failed) nodes in the explanation and green(succeeded), let the user Right click and and have a menu item for "Patch scenario"; if chosen this resp. adds a match scenario fact, or deletes it; for red (failed) nodes, add also an "Assume fact", the equivalent of clicking the assume checkbox.
Furthermore, select the fact (if added), and automatically re-run the Query

on example citizenship.le, scenario alice_harry, query one, in Scenario Variations if I select a (green) fact in the        
  explanation tree and "Patch Scenario - Delete Fact", the fact is not deleted from theSCENARIOS FACTS list. Also only        
  explanation nodes matching scenario facts should have the menu item active. And when you delete a scenario fact, reexecute  
  the Query immediately                                                                                                       

## Queries Editor
Similarly to the Scenario Editor, and similar look and feel, make a Query Editor that lets the user edit or create a query, by selecting templates and the basic connectives (and, or, it is not the case); then either copy it or insert into the editor. It does not have to support the full LE (body conditions) syntax, to stay simple

## LLM-assisted scenarios and queries
Let's add LLM-assisted, natural language input:
- Scenario Editor
In the "Add fact ..." menu add a last option "Write it in English...", which opens up a modal dialog where the user can type a sentence with one or more facts to add to the scenario. Provide a simple instruction at the top of the dialog, along the lines of "Type one or more sentences describing precise facts to be added to the scenario. The facts must respect to predicates (templates) already in your program; if you need to expand these first use the editor or the LE Assistant.".
When closing the dialog the fact(s) are added to the scenario in the Scenario Editor

- Query Editor
Similarly, in the "Add condition ..." menu add a last option "Write it in English...". Same experience as above (and try to reuse code), except that the output of the dialog is a query, to append to the query being built in the Query Editor

The user needs to have some LLM configured, same as for LE Assistant

To test the above use openai/gpt-oss-120b via groq , GROQ_API_KEY=.... (do not store this key in any file!).

### tweaks
First, remove the "..." in both "Write it in English..." menu items.

Second, english_to_le(...) needs to verify the program (with the proposed additional scenario facts or query fragment) , using a simplified variant of the LE Assistant's Light Mode.
First we  make a call to verify/2 with the program in the state prior to scenario/query Editor invovation, to obtain a baseline, "pre existing issues"; then after each agent_loop we only care about NEW issues versus that baseline. For Query/Scenarion generation, we'll use a hardwired max of 2 agent_loops. If any new issues remain after these loops, WARN the user, but let him still insert the resulting facts/query into the editor if he so choses.
The LE program resulting from these agent_loops will be discarded: we'll only retain the new scenarion facts or query.

Something seems wrong with "Write in english" in Scenario Editor. With citizenship.le tried to add a fact "Miguel was    
  born in Portugal" but got an error: " The model returned nothing that matches your templates. Try rephrasing.". this with 
  Model: openai/gpt-oss-120b. With Model: zai-org/GLM-5.2 it worked fine. I think the other model should still deal with    
  this example, not refuse it                                                                                               


## More warnings
Add a couple more warnings:
- a template containing the word if ("we would have covered your liability if you had caused *a loss*") silently corrupts
parsing of the templates section and the errors then surface on other, unrelated templates. Add a targeted verifier error ("reserved word in template"). 

- argument constants starting with the (e.g. the United Kingdom) parse as fresh variables — the verifier warns for KB facts but not for scenario facts

## More LE doc
I think docs/le_summary.md needs a new section "LE Extensions" describing features not yet summarised, namely 'only if' rules,    
'which', and possibly others gated by depending on the proprietary le_extensions.pl. And another short section at the end "Humanizing 
LE", with guidelines to use some LE features to make the progranm easier to read by humans, such as: use 'only if' or 'unless' when appropriate;   use prepositional additions; others you think of                                                                                      

## User docs
 We need links to these user documentation resources:
- https://github.com/LogicalContracts/LogicalEnglish2/blob/main/docs/tutorial0/IntroToLE2.md
- https://github.com/LogicalContracts/LogicalEnglish2/blob/main/docs/howToUse.md
- https://github.com/LogicalContracts/LogicalEnglish2/blob/main/docs/le_summary.md

In the landing page it can be direct links, with a short summary for each;  in the editor, use a new Help menu

Take a quick read of each and decide on the best order

## Executive page
We need a new minimalist entry point into the LE2 UI, for people that just want to use an existing program by querying it, picking scenarios, and eventually also using scenario variations and query editor. They may eventually look at some rules in the editor, probably not... and never edit them. 

AND it should be targetting mobile devices.

The entrypoint should be /executive?program=... , optionally with scenario and query parameters too. Without params it should present a simple menu to choose an example (all in the system; we may restrict later but not now)

Let me know if you need to discuss alternatives, otherwise just do it. Try not to depend on additional software components, I'm hoping CSS will suffice...

Remove link to Editor, and add links to Scenario Variations and Query Editor, making sure  these render reasonably on
  
Put "Scenario Variations" between scenario picker and question picker. Remove "Query" button, queries should auto-run when scenario or query 

## Abduction examples
Slides 24 and 25 of '/.../Downloads/PEG Lisbon 2026.pdf' show two ideas for examples of abductive reasoning. Please read the
whole presentation, then turn them into working LE examples at examples/moreExamples/abduction , and after that try to come up with
a more complex (third) example. Although LE has no integrity constraints, it does have unknowns...

## Permission buglet
If you try to open a restricted LE example (requiring user authentication), the editor opens silently an empty program. Instead there should be an error message and redirect to login page

## Undeclared meta templates
Example insureLE2/testing/fatconclusions.le has templates which lead to unexpected PROLOG equivalents in the facts on lines 10-16: 
variables get bound to compound terms, whereas the user would expect payments, policies and claims to be atomic. Although the user 
should probably define these as explicit types, we should warn the user that he is NOT using meta-templates (for which it would be 
natural to get such commpund terms). So when parsing a rule, if applying a template leads immediately to a compound term (because of
the recursive parsing of the rule body), IF the template does not hava "that" immediately before the bound variable, issue a new 
warning, e.g. "it seems you want to use a meta-template here, if so make sure to precede the meta variable by 'that'"
After you do this please give me all the new warnings for the LE test suite, if any, so I can eyeball them

## Debugging source graph
Remove the Graph tab, and add instead a "View Source Graph" item to the "Misc" menu,  opening a new browser tab (window). 
Update the documentation. 
Make sure it renders correctly with the selected layout algorithm and selected layers (node and edge types), as sometimes it opens with less layers than selected. The preference for these should persist in LocalStorage, not sure that's already being done.
Let the user Copy any node to the clipboard, with a contextual menu
I see le_expected(...) facts in scenarios, these should not appear in the source graph

## Multilingual
You can only access and change files in LogicalEnglish2/ and InsurLE2/.
Please execute the full plan in LogicalEnglish2/docs/MultilingualLEplan.md
You can commit changes after each phase, but don't bother me until you're done, I trust your choices :-)

### Follow up
We ned a new /multilingual entrypoint, which lets the user pick one of the supported languages - Português Lógico, etc. - (or determined that from a querystring param), then presents a landing page circumscribed to that language: only examples in that language, all UI in that language. Include a link back to the standard Logical English page (in English).
Don't commit to git.

OK, now please remove the LANGUAGE items from the "Misc" menu, to avoid confusion (Language UI different from the language in the program being edited). The preferred language cookie should be set only by the landing page (both /multilingual and the standard landing page / )
The "Home" button at top of editor should return to the proper landing page
Also, the LE Assistant always greets with "Hello! I am your Logical English Assistant. How can I help you today?", needs to be translated; ditto for the progress messages "Calling LLM (step N)", "I have updated the editor content with the changes.", "Requested completed in NN seconds"

## Bento Box
Let's add a "Bento Box" feature to display an answer. People have tried to use logic grammars to generate design structures rendere as Bento boxes, and we want to let LE authors (designers or children...) experiment.
It should take the explanation tree supporting an answer, and render it as "nested boxes", with the rule matching the root node being the outer box, its body conditions determining boxes within the outer box, etc., in a separate window.
Like in the Proof game, we need some unique colouring for each node (box), and a legend. Also look at https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/bento-box-design and https://justbento.com/handbook/bento-basics/bento-box-review-idea-bento-box-may-just-be-ideal-bento-box for inspiration of alternative ways to render boxes and their ultimate content (which will be the leaves in our explanation/proof tree). Pick something you like.
Negation (failed nodes) for now are to be represented as empty dark space.
Let's also show literals as tooltips as we hover the box.
Clicking boxes should highlight the node (source code) in the editor
oh, and wire it into the answer contextual menu    

## images
Let's introduce a simple "scenario fact addition": any scenario fact can end  with ";" and have an addition 'image URL'. Non ground facts or rules or ill-formed URL should constitute a warning. For now these images are to be used in the Bento box rendering.
Please find a few nice images on the web and use them in the sequencer example
I need you to find other images, only the tempo dial is good. Images need to be "2 dimensional", meaning, a flat object so it fits visually well in a Bento Box. also resize the images proportionally to touch the closest limits of its box - no padding around the image if we can avoit it

Another feature: let's make 'image' also an addition to templates. A template must have no variables for an image addition to be acceptbale (warn otherwise). So the Bento box will use these image URLs for rendering toom, as an alternative to scenarion images.

## s(CASP) issues
I got this running with our fly.io container:
Error: The s(CASP) engine is not installed on this server.

Please check that s(CASP) is added to the "vanilla" SWI-Prolog already there

Also, I guess you know that the language of scasp's syntax is  a subset of Prolog's that does not allow for OR in the rules. Are we checking that in LE2? 
Please check that at least we get a reasonable error if users try to use "or" 

LE is a Prolog-biased system, so let's hide the engine picker for most cases and unclutter the UI a bit:
- add a preference to the Misc menu: "Always show engine choice" (initial default) / "Show engine choice only for non-Prolog", localStorage persistent
- If the user prefers the second case, show the engine picker only of the program as a target language different from prolog

## Better "important reason"
We need a special case added to the determination of the explanation node for "Show important reason", for failed queries. 
Consider the first (going down the explanation tree as it is rendered) failed node, with zero answers. If it is a rule head, try to find a deeper (under that rule head) failed node with zero answers, otherwise return the node with the rule head. 
In summary, return as "important reason" the deepest failed node with zero answers; if more than one such node exists with the same depth (distance from explanation tree root) chose the first
If no failed node exists with zero answers, revert to the default mechanism based on tree weights. Again, this is only for failed queries.
And exclude type guard nodes

Let's refine the "important reason" for failures, tweaking the heuristic you just implemented. Instead of returning the deepest failed node... return all of them (notice that they cannot be ancestor of each other), and render the lot with "it is not the case that X, nor Y, nor..."; truncate after the third.
Make this refinement a new preferfence in the explanations preferences panel, "larger important reasons".

## Lousy run of LE Contract Assistant
First, a template should allow the word 'scenario' in it, for example "*a claim* involves a scenario tested of *a description*"; right now this causes a syntax error.

Second, I ran the LE Contract Assistant and some dumb LLM (or not so dumb, actually: GLM-5.2 !) generated duplicated templates, apparently inspired by case data with many similar instances in a JSON array; this is dumb, duplicate templates should be simply mechanically removed after each iteration, ditto for facts and rules.

Third, some LLMs are generating min(A,L) as a function, causing errors containing the string "`'min(A, L)'/0' is not a function". So add a system template  "the minimum of *X* and *Y* is *Z*" and corresponding Prolog predicate min(X,Y,Z). And edit prompts in LE Assistant and in LE Contract Assistant to use it.

Finally: I executed now the LE contract Assistant but got low quality results which I want you to analyse.
Inputs were examples/moreExamples/insurLE2/testing/fema/fema_F-122-Dwelling-SFIP_2021.md, with nearby files claims.json and expected_outcomes.json for claims, plus schedules.json. The resulting program was examples/moreExamples/insurLE2/testing/fema/fema-gpt-oss-120b.le , which has syntax errrors. 
The coverage report was "skipped", see below.

How was this possible, syntax errors, using a fast model, with plenty of time budget to spare? And the cover ledger seems a marginal effort versus the rest (?), so I think it should always be present, even if full of holes.

This was shown at the end in the web UI:

I see too many:
"iteration N ranks worse than the best so far; continuing from the best version"
Even when there are (say) errors to fix, for example this sequence:
...
Branch 2 iteration 2: 11 errors, 183 warnings, 0/15 tests passing
Branch 2: iteration 2 ranks worse than the best so far; continuing from the best version
...

How is it possible that it didn't fix (say) 1 error, and improve the program??? Too many errors being submitted in the prompt? Are they going with the hints given by the LE parser and verifier?
Or should the prompting be richer in terms of the LE syntax...?

# One more issue, Contract Assistant
- In addition to unused_template, we need an additional warning: a template for which there are scenario facts, or facts, but no rule body uses it, nor is th$$ere a query using it.
- The LE Contract Assistant must push harder for zero warnings, as some (namely the previous new issue type being added now) force "good invention" of rules. For example if a scenario fact is imposed by the user, that warning (if cleared) effectively forces some rule to use that scenario fact; ditto for a rule whose head is untested by any query (in other words, useless). I just encountered a situation where a limit for payments was being ignored even though sitting there in plain sight as a scenarion fact, so some rules handling payments ignored limits completely. So forcing zero warnings seems necessary. Should we increase patience...? Be more creative when successive changes do not improve the program (higher temperature, wild prompt variants?). Or should we add some "common sense" principles generic to most contracts, such as "statements of limits to payments in one part of the document may condition rules elsewhere in the document"... but this sounds a bit like those wild hoose chases so typical of symbolic AI...? Help!
  
# Core test suite
Currently the LE test suite (based on the expectations in LE programs) includes the programs living in directories with paths
containing "/insureLE2/". We need to distinguish "LE core tests" from "LE core + extensions tests"; the former should exclude
any LE programs depending on proprietary extensions; we can simply hardwire this somewhere near the test runner, e.g.a table
of excluded path fragments for the core test suite.
Do that and make notes in README.md, CLAUDE.md etc on how to run both suites (core only, or with extensions).
So that other teams can depend on the core test suite runner for their CI flows.

# the white rabbit

We got this recommendation from LE's father: 
'the white rabbit' should not be a variable unless it is introduced in the same rule by 'a white rabbit'. When it is not so introduced, it is a global constant. We used this approach very effectively in our legal applications.

Implement it; add a simple test example with it.

# IDE improvements
Let's have the possibility to open multiple (file) tabs in the editor, in the style of another IDE, see MultipleEditorPanes.png. Related panes (Query, LE Assistant etc) should refresh accordingly. file operations should act on the current pane.

When a LE file is large or has many scenarios, some time it taks several seconds between the user clicking on the scenario or quiery picker, and the menu popping up; add a waiting cursor.

# LE Views comments
Please move the LE Views section from /InsurLE2/docs/CustomsOfficerReport.md to its own docs/IntroducingLEViews.md, and expand it enough to
be a self contained tutorial; place a reference to it in CustomsOfficerReport.md

Add a "Open Executive View" item to the editor Misc menu, which will open that UI in a new window

Bug: when opening http://localhost:3050/executive?program=RulesRus%2Fcustoms%2Fcbp_61, it hangs; Javascript console shows
Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'links.hidden = !views.length'),
executive/apps.js:129; refreshing the page makes it "work" ;-)

In http://localhost:3050/executive?program=RulesRus%2Fcustoms%2Fcbp_61&scenario=ny_n274193&query=subheading, showing a list of
51 citations before the "full explanation" (also big, but at least indented) seems a bit weird.... so bring the "Full
explanation" link forward to the top, in case the user wants to jump to it

In examples/RulesRus/sections_benefit.le, the Proof Game's "Show Proof" lays out a tree, but no prize (no green!)

# Changes summary
Logical English and LPS (repo here at /lps2 ) have gone through substantial improvements since last Sep 10 until today. Look at the changes, as well as the design/planning documents in /InsurLE2/docs that motivated mosyt of them - MiggratingFromOtherSystems.md , RulesRUs.md and the associated LE_extensions_proposal.md. Then write a /InsurLE2/docs/MidSeptemberLeap.md describing those changes, organised in sections for LE/InsurLE and LPS, and by topics and features under those, including small language fragments when language extensions are involved. Use a technically precise, low key academic tone. Zero cockiness. Refer main files for each feature, as well as the application/domain requirements motivating them (short sentences with pointers to those planning documents). Include screenshots for the IDE  UI improvements.
AND then add a small summary TLDR-like at the beginning, no more than a page. And a TOC

# Example for Bob
LE's father looked closely at examples/moreExamples/LogicalThinkingInAgeOfAI/heart_failure.le , and he expressed these concerns:

I am worried, when there are several treatments recommended for a patient, the representation does not distinguish between alternative treatments and additional treatments. For example, diuretics is an additional treatment, not an alternative treatment.

I looked at the example using the proof game. I noticed that the game is still not instantiating variables. Even the automatically  generated 'show proof' version does not bind variables, as shown below. Notice also that the proof of the third condition of the top level rule is not shown.

(Proof game screenshot at examples/moreExamples/LogicalThinkingInAgeOfAI/badGame.png)

# Bugs from Jacinto, etc.

## Comment colouring
In some large comments sometimes the editor is colouring some of the text and it shouldn't; for example examples/moreExamples/collections/kowalski-book/underground_emergency.le, starting at line 9

## Example aliases/synonyms
The example tree now uses aliases, for example examples/moreExamples/collections/kowalski-book/underground_emergency can be edited via URL /editor/index.html?example=rkBook/underground_emergency ; where are these synonyms defined? Shouldn't this be in the documentation somewhere?

## Proof Game
The Proof Game refuses to open for a failed query ("You need a query with an answer to play"). however it is able to deal with NAF... couldn't we allow the game to play for a failed top node too?

## Improving generation of displays
The 2D and 3D animations generated by the assistant seem still very basic and erractic, as indicated in the display problems below. Maybe the prompts and generation process could be improved. Some wild thoughts, but you please do some research too:
-   might our Automaton states (the finite automata perspective on the program) provide hints about relevance or focus ?
-   Might an Interactive Fiction perspective help? a 2d/3d rendering of an execution tells its "narrative" graphically. Can one detect high level patterns either in the source - composite events, intensional fluents and their dependencies - or in the execution trace (in addition to the basic geometry ones like stack) that guide the narrative building hence the scene construction? Perhaps use multiple scenes for important program states...?


Now the two reported problems, that occurred for /lps2/examples/collections/kowalski-book/underground.lps :

### Display problem 1
an animation I generated (sorry I lost its  display facts by now) showed a fire on top of a box to signal the emergency fire. It would be interesting seeing the other fluents too:  alerted, in_station, stopped.

### Display problem 2
In another run the assistant generated these facts:

display(emergency(Value), [type:rectangle, from:[0.00, 0.00], to:[150.00, 40.00],
		     fillColor:'#2f3542', label:(Emergency:Value)]).

display(penalty(Value), [type:rectangle, from:[162.00, 0.00], to:[312.00, 40.00],
		     fillColor:'#2f3542', label:(Penalty:Value)]).


display(timeless, [
	[type:rectangle, from:[-14, -26], to:[326.00, 86.00], strokeColor:'#2a2f3a'],
	[type:text, point:[0.00, 44.00], content:'Emergency', fontSize:11, fillColor:'#8b94a6'],
	[type:text, point:[162.00, 44.00], content:'Penalty', fontSize:11, fillColor:'#8b94a6'],
	[type:text, point:[0, 66.00], content:'London Underground Emergency Notice', fontSize:15, fillColor:'#dfe3ea']
	]).    

...again not covering 3 of the 5 fluents (and I think we should display at least all fluents that CHANGE over the program's execution), and which resulted in the weird rendering in underground.png , notice the '_24584:fire'. 

## 'No such session' bug

# Memoization
Two tasks:

First, move "embedded prolog goals" (...prolog G...) from proprietary extensions to the open source core, they are there by mistake; update documentation and examples accordingly.

Second, a new query evaluation feature:

Currently we already detect redundancies in explanations, but only after fully executing a query and building its explanation tree for each answer. Time to anticipate this technique to query execution, introducing partial memoization. I'm not comfortable with using tabling, because of complications with multithreading etc., neither with the cost memoizing all calls. So instead let's cache specific predicates on request, to address specific performance problems in some large proghrama:
- new template addition: "memorable". 
- A memorable predicate gets its call and answers with explanations list cached (during execution of the query; I think it's unsafe to cache it in the LE session, given scenario changes etc, but let me know otherwise)
- cache hitting is via call term variance, not unification; a memorable predicate call must be a variant of of a cached call for the cache to be used; use term hashes for indexing
- only completely cached calls are used (to avoid a recomputation), meaning, the call must have produced all answers and FAIL; naturally the cache may contain incomplete calls, which are still active
- if some NAF construct (negation, otherwise, unless, etc) calls a memorable predicate, issue a warning (as the memorable calls may be unable to complete, therefore their caching effort will be useless)
- if a memorable predicate calls a Prolog embedded goal, issue a warning (as this goal could alter state invalidating the cached answers)

Draft a couple examples for illustrating this. Also look at the slowest program in the LE test suite, and try to add a single memorable addition to there to try to improve speed. Update documentation.

# Language changing, editor tab selection
An user of LE complained that the IDE rendering its menus in Spanish, just because he was writing a program in Espanol Lógico.
First, let's make the preferred language settable in the IDE, persisting in LocalStorage; on first use, adopt the browser's preferred language
Second, add some user documentation on the use of the multiple Logical English dialects (Espanol Lógico, Português Lógico etc); I couldn't find it easily
Finally, another request relating to the IDE's UI, both LE and /lps2's: make sure that, when several tabs are open in the editor, if the user navigates from the entry page to the editor by clicking an example... this example's tab is selected, which is currently not always the case

# Bugs reported by Jacinto
Please figure out the examples from their URLs below.
## highlighting
In https://le2.logicalcontracts.com/editor/index.html?example=enclosure&scenario=test&query=three&answer=1 , the highlighting of 
        and it is not the case that
in line 33 is wrong. "and" is correctly in purple. But "it is not the case" must also be purple. Not only the "that" at the end (which is correct).

## discrepancy
In https://le2.logicalcontracts.com/editor/index.html?example=migration%2Fscasp%2Fobligation%2Fobligation&scenario=test&engine=scasp&query=query_1&answer=1

There is a discrepancy between the answer:

the borrower cures the failure of any obligation on 2016-06-02 that any requirement

and the explanation:

the borrower cures the failure of an obligation on 2016-06-02 that the borrower pays 525 to the lender on a date
  the borrower pays 525 to the lender on 2016-06-02

The explanation is correct. 

## wrong answer
In https://le2.logicalcontracts.com/editor/index.html?example=migration%2Fscasp%2Fsubset%2Fsubset&scenario=two&query=query_1&engine=scasp&answer=2

It is producing this wrong answer:

[Alice Bob] is a subset of [Alice]

with this explanation

[Alice Bob] is a subset of [Alice]
  [Alice Bob] is a set
  [Alice] is a set
  x le_forall_1(['Alice','Bob'],['Alice'])
    x a thing belongs to [Alice Bob]
      x an any is in [Alice Bob]

Both are wrong

## Questionable comment in program example
In https://le2.logicalcontracts.com/editor/index.html?example=abduction%2Fdiagnosis&scenario=checkup&query=diagnose&answer=4

..its commentaries say this:

% Logical English has no integrity constraints, but the effect of slide 28's
% passive constraint ("it is not the case that the sprinkler was on if the
% sprinkler is broken") is obtained here with negation as failure over closed
% (scenario) facts: 

Don't we have integrity constraints in pure LE already...? If so, just edit the comment, the example is working fine

## Noise in explanation
In https://le2.logicalcontracts.com/editor/index.html?example=happy_dragon&scenario=smoky&query=happy&engine=scasp&answer=2

Scasp is working well in this example, but the explanation contains that le_forall/1 reference

alice is happy
  alice is a dragon
  x le_forall_1(alice)
    x alice is a parent of a dragon
    alice is a parent of bob
    bob is healthy
      bob is a dragon
      x bob smokes
        x a creature is a parent of bob
        alice is a parent of bob
        alice is a dragon
        x alice smokes
          x a creature is a parent of alice
          x alice is a parent of alice

# Making of
Users have expressed concerns about the authorship of examples in LE and LPS, specifically whether they were invented by an agent (you or a predecessor of yours), or generated by a deterministic converter from some twin original, or adapted from a book by you, etc. So I want you to please go over every example folder in the LPS2 and LE2 systems, and, if the folder contains files not authored by a humann, add a MAKING_OF.md file summarising how the examples were built. This file will not be visible in the IDEs, it will simply be stored in our repositories.

So for examples/es, note that the original versions were translated by yourself from the examples in English; for miggration twins, refer the Prolog file with the converter that produce them; etc.

# Language menu
In the editor, make the language picking menu a second level menu under item "Langauge"; as it stands it taks too much scree space


# Shorter test suite

In the editor, "Show s(CASP)" should appear only if the selected engine is s(CASP)
