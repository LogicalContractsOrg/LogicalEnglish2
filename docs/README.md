# LogicalEnglish2 documentation

| Folder | What | Published |
|---|---|---|
| [`user/`](user/) | the user documentation: tutorials, guides, references, the API. [`user/nav.json`](user/nav.json) is its table of contents, from which the editor's Help menu, the landing page and the documentation viewer are built | yes, at `/docs/user/…` |
| [`dev/`](dev/) | how the system is built: architecture, the assistants, migration, the debugger, the graph, telemetry | no |
| [`project/`](project/) | plans, papers, research material, and an archive of superseded documents | no |

The viewer's shared script, `web_extras/docsview/docs-extras.js` (identical in LE2 and LPS2:
keep the copies equal), gives every document three things. **Search**:
`/docs/search?q=…` searches the documents of `nav.json`, section by section,
deterministically; a document not in `nav.json` is not searched. **Links to
the other IDE**: write them as `https://lps2.logicalcontracts.com/docs/user/…`
(from LE2) or `https://le2.logicalcontracts.com/docs/user/…` (from LPS2); the
viewer rewrites them to wherever the other IDE is (le2.DOMAIN ↔ lps2.DOMAIN; on
localhost ports 3000 ↔ 3060; `?peer=<origin>` overrides). **Diagrams**:
`mermaid` code blocks are drawn with the local `mermaid.min.js`, and their
`click` links are rewritten the same way.

Every document says under its title what kind of document it is, for whom,
and whether it is current. A plan that has been implemented says where its
result is documented.

## How documents are written

The readers are lawyers, underwriters, policy officers and other domain
experts as much as programmers, so every document — and every piece of text
the software puts in front of a reader, such as a menu tip, an explanation of
an answer, or an assistant's reply — is written to be understood by someone
with no technical training.

- **Name the thing instead of pointing at it.** Use a pronoun only when the
  noun it stands for is the one just before it and no other noun could be
  meant. Never open a sentence with *it*, *this*, *that*, *these* or *they*
  standing for the whole sentence before: repeat the noun.
- **No computing jargon without plain words in the same sentence.** Words such
  as *parse*, *instantiate*, *serialise*, *hook*, *callback*, *back end*,
  *repository*, *endpoint* and *payload* are replaced by ordinary English, or
  explained where they first appear. Name a file, a predicate or a setting
  only where the reader has to go and look at it.
- **One idea per sentence, in the order things happen.** Prefer a subject that
  acts: *the editor checks the document*, rather than *the document is
  checked*.
- **Spell out an abbreviation the first time each document uses it.**
- The names of the ideas these systems teach — a fluent, an event, a template,
  a scenario, a reactive rule — are part of the language being taught. Use
  them freely, and define each one at first use or in the glossary.

The LLM features read documents by path — the language reference in
particular (`le_assistant_light.pl`, lpsPlus's `contract_assistant/le_contract_assistant.pl`,
`AGENTS_LE_template*.md`, `llm/mcp.pl`): move one only together with them.
`vibeCodingNotes.md` is private notes, not served and not in the image.
