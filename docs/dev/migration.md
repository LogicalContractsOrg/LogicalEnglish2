# Migrating programs into Logical English: the shared machinery

*Kind: reference · Audience: developers · Status: current (2026-09-23)*

This is the reference for the infrastructure every translator into Logical
English shares — Phase 0 of the roadmap in
`lpsPlus/docs/migration/roadmap.md` (§4 and §8). The source-specific
readers (Socotra, Oracle Intelligent Advisor, Bitcoin Miniscript, Solidity)
live in the lpsPlus repository (`lpsPlus/migration/`) and are described
there; everything here is core LE and has no knowledge of any source system.
The twins they write live with the language they are written in: timeless LE
twins in this repository's `examples/migration/<source>/` (Blawx, LegalRuleML,
Miniscript, OIPA, s(CASP)), LE-for-LPS twins in `lps2/examples/migration/<source>/`
(Daml, Drools, Solidity), and those whose sources are not cleared for
publication in `lpsPlus/examples/migration/` (`le2_paths:twins_dir/2` there
says which).

## 0. Opening another system's file (`le_import.pl`)

`File > Open` in the editor, and the LPS2 IDE's `File > Open` for a `.sol`,
send a file that is not Logical English to the operation `importForeign`,
which hands it to the translator registered for it. A translator registers
itself with one clause (the proprietary translators are listed in
`lpsPlus/migration/le_importers.pl`, which `le_kbs.pl` loads through the
`le_importers.pl` link in this directory):

```prolog
le_import:importer(Id, Title, Extensions, File, Module:Import, Module:Detect).
%   call(Import, +Input, +OutDir, -imported(LEFile, Notes))
%   call(Detect, +Input)       % decides for shared extensions (zip, xml, json, txt)
```

The upload is kept under `tmp/imports/<id>/` for a day: an archive is
extracted there (members leaving the tree are skipped), the translation is
written beside it, and the program opens as the example
`imported/<id>/<name>` (le_example_relpath/2), so its includes and cited
documents resolve. A fragment the translator cannot translate is written
into the program as a residue block, whose first line is `% TODO: …`
(`le_writer:write_residue/2`); a file no translator reads, or one whose
translator fails, still opens: its text as a TODO comment, with the reason.
`importFormats` lists the registered translators (the editor's file picker
offers their extensions; `File > Import from Another System…` offers only
theirs). Tests: `testing/test_le_import.pl`,
`editor/tests/import-foreign.spec.ts`.

**The originals: `sources/` beside the program.** What a program was
converted from is kept in a `sources/` folder beside it, and the editor's
`File > Show the Original…` (operation `originals`, which lists that folder's
text files; each opens in the source viewer through `documentText`) shows
it. `le_import.pl` copies an upload there unless the translator has already
put the files its citations use there itself (the Socotra adapter does, under
the product's own paths); a migration writing twins does the same (the
Solidity twins' contracts, the Socotra products' configuration files, the OIA
projects' text files, the documents the miniscript twins quote). A document
the program cites with `the text of D is at "sources/…"` is then one of
those files. The LPS2 IDE's *View ▸ The original this was converted from*
reads the same folder for a program opened from its server. The editor's
example list does not descend into a `sources/` folder: it holds originals,
not programs.

**The other way: exporting (`exporter/6`).** `File > Export to Another
System…` in the editor (and the LPS2 IDE's Misc ▸ Export to another
system…, through `le_service:le_export/4`) writes the loaded program in
another system's format. An exporter registers itself with one clause:

```prolog
le_import:exporter(Id, Title, Extension, File, Module:Export, Module:Applies).
%   call(Applies, +KB)                      % is it a program of this kind?
%   call(Export, +KB, +Options, -Result)    % exported(FileName, Text, Notes, Links)
%                                           % or refused(Problems)
%       Options: text(Doc), base(Dir); Links: [link(Title, Url)] — a public
%       sandbox or playground the result opens in
le_import:export_check(Id, Module:Check).
%   call(Check, +KB, +Options, -Problems)   % [problem(Where, Message)], Where
%                                           % at(Start, End) | line(N) | none
```

KB is the loaded knowledge base, so an exporter reads the program through
`le_writer:kb_to_ir/2` (or the LPS translation), never its text. Operations
`exportFormats` (the exporters that apply to a program) and `exportForeign`
(the text, notes and links); the editor lists only the exporters that apply,
and shows the result to copy or save, with its notes and a button per link.
Tests: `testing/test_le_import.pl` (a made-up exporter with a check),
`editor/tests/import-foreign.spec.ts` (both ways, and a refusal). The
lpsPlus exporters and their checks are registered in
`lpsPlus/migration/le_importers.pl` beside the importers.

**Exporting: the check before the text.** What an exporter cannot express
is never dropped silently, and there are two kinds of it. A *problem* loses
meaning — a rule, fact, condition or declaration the target has no faithful
form for — and the program is **refused**: nothing is written, and the
reply (`le_import:export_refusal/4`) is `{error, exporter, problems}`, each
problem `{line, message, text}` (the line and the program's own words
there). The editor shows the list, each line a link to it (`#export-refused`);
the LPS2 IDE the same in its dialog. A *note* loses no meaning (comments,
queries and expected answers, layout, a key named after its role) and
travels with the written text. `export_kb/4` runs the exporter's
`export_check` before `Export` (and passes `checked(true)` so it need not
check again); an `Export` that meets a problem only while translating
answers `refused(Problems)`. `Applies` and the check are two things on
purpose: Applies decides what the menu offers (a program of the kind), the
check whether this one can be written — an offered exporter may refuse, and
its list says what to change. LE's integrity constraints (`it must not be
true that …`) are not in the Migration IR: an exporter to a target without
constraints asks `le_import:kb_constraint_problems/3` for them.

Every other conversion of an LE or LPS program into another language
refuses the same way, with the same reply:

| conversion | where | the check |
|---|---|---|
| LE → Miniscript, LegalRuleML, Daml | `lpsPlus/migration/{miniscript,legalruleml,daml}` | `check_miniscript/3`, `check_lrml/3`, `check_daml/3` |
| LE → s(CASP) (See s(CASP), the s(CASP) engine) | `le_scasp.pl` | `le_scasp_check/3`: an emitter issue that loses meaning (docs/user/reference/scasp.md §8) |
| LE for LPS → LPS (`getLps`, LPS2's `le_compile`, Deploy as Solidity, the LPS exporters) | `le_lps.pl` | any error issue, including `not_lps` (lps2's docs/user/reference/le-for-lps.md §8): no LPS text |
| LPS → Solidity | `lpsPlus/migration/solidity/lps_solidity.pl` (LPS2's Deploy as Solidity, loaded by its `src/syntax/lps_plus.pl`) | `lps_to_solidity/3`'s refusal (reactive rules, Prolog, enumeration, …) |
| LPS → LE (a document) | `le_lps_write.pl` | `le_lps_check/3`; `residue(true)` (a translator into LE) writes a comment instead |
| an LPS program in the older syntax → LE | `le_lps_write.pl`, `le_lps_from_internal/4` | the templates are invented from the relations' own names and tied back with `; known as`; everything the surface cannot say comes back as an issue. LPS2's `src/syntax/lps_to_le.pl` reads the `.lps` file and calls it |

Out of scope, and why: LE → Prolog is LE's own compilation, not a
translation; the Mermaid export is a diagram of the program, not a program;
Deploy as WASM bundles the same LPS program with its engine; the legal view
(`le_lps_legal.pl`) is an explanatory reading of a run, not a program meant
to be equivalent; PDDL, Inform 7 and DRL are read into LPS, never written.

## 1. The Migration IR

A translator's output is a Prolog term, not text:

```prolog
program(Header, Items)
```

### Header

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kb(Name)` | the knowledge base's name |
| `target(prolog)` / `target(lps)` | the target language (default `prolog`) |
| `language(Lang)` | the program's language (`en`, `pt`, `es`, `fr`, `it`; default `en`) |
| `comment(Text)` | a comment block at the top (attribution, source, licence) |
| `includes([Resource, ...])` | `the knowledge base N includes these resources:` |
| `extends([Base, ...])` | `the knowledge base N extends Base, ....` (target `lps`, le_lps_surface.md §1.1) |
| `services([service(Name, Address, Kind), ...])` | `... includes these services:` |
| `provenance_required` | `scenario facts require provenance.` |
| `extensions(true\|false\|auto)` | whether the document may use the InsurLE extensions — `all of`/`either` blocks, numbered outlines. Default **false**: the writer produces core LE, which reads on a server without `le_extensions.pl`; `auto` allows them when the module is loaded |
| `setting(max_time, N)` etc. | LPS settings |

### Items

| Item | Written as |
|---|---|
| `template(F, Text, Additions)` | a line of `the templates are:`. `F` is the translator's name for the predicate (its literals use it, with as many arguments as `Text` has places); LE derives its own functor from the words, and the two never need to agree. `Text` is the declaration, `"*a person* is born in *a place* on *a date*"`. Additions: `undefined`, `assumable`, `judged`, `prepositional`, `opposite(Text)`, `synonym(Text)`, `via_service(S)`, `known_as(F)`, `default(V)` (a fluent's `; V by default`), `included` (declared by an included resource or a base: known for writing, not written) |
| `constant(F, Name, Value)` | a line of `the constants are:` (`Name is Value.`, le_summary.md §2.2); `F` is the functor of its template `the value of Name is *a type*` (`the_value_of_<name words>_is`), whose one-place goal a body uses where the value is read — the writer writes the name there |
| `function(F, Text)` / `function(F, Text, Additions)` | a line of `the functions are:` (docs/user/reference/language.md §2.3): a template of the form `... is *a value*` whose value may be written without that last place. Emit it for a relation the source says is functional (a rate, a lookup, a computed field), and the writer writes the compact form — `and the price of the cup > 10` rather than a condition binding the value and another using it — wherever the value is used and its inputs are already known |
| `fluent/event/action(F, Text, Additions)` | the LPS declaration sections |
| `rule(Head, Body, Options)` | a rule. Options: `label(L)` (`rule L:`), `provenance(P)` (with a label: `rule L with provenance ...:`), `numbered(true)` (a numbered outline, docs/user/reference/extensions.md §15.5 — written only with `extensions(true)` in the header, a plain body otherwise), `comment(Text)` |
| `fact(Head, Options)` | a fact; Options `provenance(P)` (trailers), `ontology` (in `the ontology is:`) |
| `constraint(Body, Options)` | an integrity constraint, `it must not be true that` and the conditions (le_summary.md §3.3); Options `comment(Text)` |
| `table(Name, Options, Columns, Rows)` | a decision table (§17.3). Options: `policy(first\|unique\|all)`, `loaded_from(File)`, `provenance(P)`. Cells: a constant, `any`, `or_list([...])`, `cond(E)` with `E` built from `Op-Value` (`(>=)-1`) and `and/2`, `or/2`, `quote(Text)` (a citation column), `raw(Text)` |
| `section(Name)` | `section Name is:` |
| `residue(Id, Options)` | a residue block (§4): Options `title(T)`, `locator(L)`, `source(Language, Code)`, `note(Text)`, `placeholder(LE)`, `conclusion(Sentence)` (the LE sentence the block must conclude, constants included: written as `%   concludes: ...`), `provenance(Trailers)` (what follows `with provenance` in a rule label — `"the act", at "s. 4", confer "..."`: written as `%   provenance: ...`, and given to each rule the translation writes), `concludes([F, ...])` (what the block must conclude — the expectations that depend on it are pending, §3) |
| `document(Name, Options)` | `Name is published at "..."` / `the text of Name is at "..."`: Options `url(U)`, `text(Path)` |
| `scenario(Name, Lines, Options)` | a scenario. Lines: `fact(L)`, `fact(L, Provenance)`, `unknown(L)`, `rule(H, B)`, `expects(Query, Answers)`, `expects(Query, Answers, Unknowns)`, `expects_changes(Query, Sets)`, `pending(Why, Line)` (a line written as a comment, with its reason), `comment(T)`. Answers are strings or ground IR literals (written through their templates). Options: `as_stated_in(Doc)`, `at(Locator)` — the scenario's default provenance |
| `query(Name, Body)` / `query(Name, flip(Goal))` | a query; its variables are written `which <type>` |
| `view(Name, Sentences)` | a view (§17.10), its sentences verbatim |
| `comment(Text)`, `blank`, `raw(Text)` | verbatim material in the knowledge base |
| `lps(Term)` | an LPS internal-syntax term (target `lps`), written by `le_lps_write.pl` |

**Provenance** is a list of `according_to(Source)`, `as_stated_in(Document)`,
`at(Locator)`, `confer(Quote)`, `because(Reason)`. A document whose name would
not read back as a constant (`policy.json`) is written in quotes; a locator is
written as plain words (`coverages[2]` becomes `coverages 2`).

**Bodies** combine `and/2`, `or/2`, `not/1` (or Prolog's `,`, `;`, `\+`, `->`),
`otherwise([Alt1, Alt2, ...])`, `forall(Condition, Goal)`,
`agg(Op, Element, Goal, Result)` (Op one of `sum count average min max`),
`according_to(Goal, Scope)`, `prolog(Goal)`, comparisons (`<`, `=<`, `>`, `>=`,
or LE's `le_gt/2` ...), `X is Expr` / `le_assign(X, Expr)` (arithmetic with
`+ - * / // mod` and `round/floor/ceiling/truncate/integer/abs/sign/sqrt`),
`X = Y`, `X \= Y`, `member(X, List)`, `min(X, Y, Z)`, `max(X, Y, Z)`, and
literals of the IR's templates. `max(A, B)` and `min(A, B)` inside a formula
or a comparison (`Z is max(X, Y) + 1`) are written as the conditions `the
maximum of X and Y is M` before it (LE has no min/max functions); any other
function LE has no form for (`**`, `^`) makes the rule an error issue
(`rule_not_written`) and a `%` comment naming it — a rule, or constraint, the
writer cannot write is never dropped without both. LE's own internal forms (`le_at/3`, the
aggregate terms, `le_type_check/2`) are accepted too, which is how a loaded
knowledge base becomes IR.

Build conjunctions left-associated — `and(and(A, B), C)` — which is how LE
reads sibling lines; `le_writer:prolog_to_ir/3` does it for Prolog sources.

## 2. The writer (`le_writer.pl`)

```prolog
le_write(+IR, -Text).
le_write(+IR, -Text, -Issues).        % issue(Severity, Code, Message)
kb_to_ir(+KBModule, -IR).             % a loaded knowledge base, back to IR
le_write_kb(+KBModule, -Text).
prolog_file_to_ir(+File, +Options, -IR).   % plain Prolog or s(CASP), §5.7
prolog_to_ir(+Terms, +Options, -IR).
render_ground_literal(+Dicts, +Literal, -Text).   % an expected answer
template_text_dict(+Text, -Dict).
```

What it writes is the current language: decision tables, `otherwise`
cascades, provenance trailers, rule labels, numbered outlines, the ontology
section — never comments standing in for them. What it cannot write it
reports in `Issues` (a literal with no template, a nested group that needs the
InsurLE blocks when they are unavailable, a constant it had to quote).

**Nesting.** A body is written as a tree of lines the way LE reads it back:
sibling lines fold left to right with their connectives, and a line's nested
lines fold onto that line's literal — `and(a, or(b, c))` is `a` / `and b` /
`    or c`. A group with no line of its own to open with is written under one
of its plain conditions: an `otherwise` cascade nested under a connective
under the first condition of its first alternative (a line opening with
`otherwise` starts a new alternative of the block it is in, so the guard is
the whole alternative, language.md §17.2); a group whose first condition is
a negation block, a universal or an aggregate under the first plain
condition that can be moved in front of it — one whose variables shared
with the conditions jumped over are bound by then (`core_single/4`). Only
when no such condition exists is the group an `all of` / `either` block of
the extensions, and the writer reports it (`needs_extensions`).

**Variables** are named from the type of the template place each first fills
(`a person`, `a second person`, `the person`); one that takes part in
arithmetic, a comparison or an aggregate also gets an id (`an amount A`, then
`A`); in a query the first mention is `which person`. A variable is never
given the name of a definite constant of its clause (`the policy` a constant:
the policy variable is `a second policy`). Articles, ordinals and `which` come
from `i18n/writer_words.csv`, so the writer writes Portuguese, Spanish, French
and Italian programs in their own words.

**Constants** are written as LE reads them back: numbers (with the language's
decimal separator), ISO dates, strings in double quotes, lists, and atoms bare
unless LE would read the bare atom as something else — an indefinite phrase,
a number, a connective, an id in a rule — in which case they are quoted.

**The round trip** is the writer's claim, tested on the whole example corpus:

```
./myswipl.sh -q -g "consult('testing/le_writer_roundtrip.pl')" -g "le_writer_roundtrip:main" -t halt
```

LE → knowledge base → IR → LE → knowledge base must give the same clauses,
scenario facts, expectations, queries and table rows up to variable names
(113 of 115 programs; the two exclusions are stated with their reasons in the
file). `testing/test_le_writer.pl` runs a sample of it, the IR forms one by
one, and the Prolog path.

**s(CASP), in detail (Phase 2c).** The reader is LE's s(CASP) target read
backwards (`docs/user/reference/scasp.md` §4, §13): `-p(X)` is p's opposite form
(`; opposite:`, its wording from `#pred -p(X) :: …` or made from p's);
`#abducible` (or the target's `le_unknown/1` records) `; unknown`; `:- B.` and
`false :- B.` denials become integrity constraints, `it must not be true that
B` (le_summary.md §3.3: as in s(CASP), a case whose facts meet them answers
nothing, and no answer may assume what would meet them — before LE had
timeless constraints they were queries `denial_<n>` the scenarios expected to
have no answer, convention N1); `#>`, `#>=`,
`#<`, `#=<`, `#<>` comparisons and `#=` an assignment; `?- Q.` queries
`query_<n>`; the target's `le_forall_K` helpers fold back into universals;
several `#pred` wordings of one predicate are its synonyms; `is_a/2` is LE's
own form; a clause that takes a list apart (`[H|T]`) is a residue block; a
template whose words would read as one of LE's own forms (`X is Y`, `X is in
Y`) changes a word. Option `language(L)` writes in the program's language.
The target is `scasp` when the source has abducibles, classical negation or
denials. The round trip `testing/scasp_roundtrip.pl` (83 of 88 programs
exact) and `testing/test_scasp_reader.pl` test it.

**Plain Prolog and s(CASP) (§5.7).** `prolog_file_to_ir/3` reads a Prolog file
(or an s(CASP) file: `#pred p(X) :: '@(X) is ...'` annotations give the
wording) and verbalises the rest naively, each place named after the first
variable found in it in the clauses (a one-letter variable, or none, says
nothing: `*a thing*`, `*a second thing*`): `parent(X, Y)` becomes `*a thing*
is the parent of *a second thing*`, `parent(Parent, Child)` `*a parent* is the
parent of *a child*`. A two-place predicate with a number in its second place
in some fact (`age(bob, 55)`) is worded as a value, `the age of *a thing* is
*a second thing*`; the place is not typed `number` (its name still comes from
the variables). Built-in goals become `prolog` goals. The test
(`prolog_to_le` in `test_le_writer.pl`) runs the source in Prolog, turns its
answers into expectations and checks the LE program reproduces them.

## 3. The ledger, the source tests and fidelity (`le_migration.pl`)

```prolog
migration(Meta, IR, Ledger, Tests)
Meta   = [source(System), artifacts([...]), translator(Name), program(Name),
          date(D), licence(L)]
Ledger = [entry(Element, Kind, Verdict, Mapping, InProgram, Note), ...]
          Verdict: encoded | approximated | residue
Tests  = [test(Id, Document, Locator, Facts, Expectations), ...]
          Facts: literals, fact(L, Provenance), unknown(L), rule(H, B) (a
          rule of the scenario), comment(Text)

write_migration(+Migration, +Dir, +Base, -Report).
    % writes Dir/Base.le, runs its source tests, writes Base.ledger.md
    % and Base.ledger.json
migration_text/3, source_tests_scenarios/2, ledger_markdown/3,
ledger_dict/3, ledger_counts/2, migration_fidelity/3, copy_library/2.
```

**Pending expectations.** An expectation whose query depends on what an
untranslated residue block must conclude cannot hold yet: when the residue
item declares `concludes([F, ...])` (IR functors), `le_migration` follows the
IR's rules from each query and turns every expectation that reaches one of
them into `pending(Why, Expectation)` — written as a comment in its scenario
(`% pending — waits for residue r1:`), counted in the ledger, restored when the
block is translated. A reader may also mark an expectation pending itself —
`pending('approximated — ...', expects(...))` for a documented departure from
the source — instead of leaving a test the twin fails by design.

Each source test becomes a scenario whose header cites it
(`scenario t3 is, as stated in "tests.xlsx" at case 3:`), so every fact of it
carries that provenance into explanations. `migration_fidelity/3` runs the
written program's tests with `runTestsFor/2` and reports each source test as
reproduced or not; the ledger shows the counts of encoded / approximated /
residue elements beside that pass rate, one row per source element, and a
Residue section for what was left to the assistant.

## 4. Residue: the assistant translates only what the translator could not

A translator writes what it could not translate as a residue block:

```le
% RESIDUE r3 BEGIN: the collision rating plugin
%   source: plugins/rating.js lines 40-61
%   javascript:
%   | if (vehicle.age > 10) { premium = premium * 1.2; }
% RESIDUE r3 END
```

The Contract Assistant's `residue` mode (request field `mode: "residue"`,
`program`: the skeleton; optional `text`: background) asks the model for one
fenced block per residue (```` ```le residue r3 ````), splices each between
its markers itself — so no reply can change the skeleton — verifies the whole
program and runs its scenarios (the source's tests), and repairs the residue
until they pass: a skeleton test that passed and fails after the splice is a
`regression` error. An optional `% RESIDUE TEMPLATES BEGIN` / `END` region in
the templates section receives the templates a residue needs (```` ```le
residue templates ````). A residue that names the sentence it must conclude
— a `%   concludes: <sentence>` line, or the first quoted sentence of its
`% TODO` line — is checked: a block whose conclusions lose the sentence's
constants (`a counterparty meets a condition.` for `a counterparty meets
condition c1`, a fact about every counterparty and every condition) or never
reach them is a `residue_conclusion` error, repaired like a failing test. This
matters most when the skeleton has no scenarios, where nothing else would
notice. The job's ledger lists each residue as translated, declined (a comment
saying why) or open (its placeholder, such as `it is unknown whether ...`,
kept as it was). A declined block keeps the skeleton's own lines after the
comment, whatever the reply held: a block left with only a comment would
turn its unknown into a failure of every rule that asks for it.

A skeleton may hold hundreds of residues (an opinion's coverage matrix: 359).
Asked for all of them in one reply, a model takes the cheapest way out — the
same general sentence for each, or every placeholder kept — so the job works
in batches: one draft call per batch of `residue_batch` residues (request
field, default 20), each call seeing the skeleton shortened to that batch
(`residue_focus_program/4`: the other residue blocks left out and, when the
program is still long, the knowledge-base paragraphs that neither hold nor
call one of the batch's residues, each run of them replaced by a comment).
Repair rounds work the same way, one batch of the residues that still have
problems at a time, whenever every problem belongs to a residue. Two results
count as not done, and rank an attempt below one that translates:

- `residue_open` — a placeholder kept as it was with no comment saying why
  (a comment such as `% kept unknown: an assumption about the transaction`
  makes it declined);
- `residue_restates` — a translation whose conditions are all conditions the
  rule calling the residue already checks (the counterparty's kind, legal
  form, jurisdiction), or that has none: it adds nothing the text required.

**Provenance.** A residue whose header has a `%   provenance: <trailers>` line
(the word is `residue_provenance` in `i18n/writer_words.csv`) gives it to each
rule of its translation, when the job splices it in: `rule c22 with provenance
<trailers>:`, then `c22_2`, and so on. A rule translated from a residue then
cites the source as the rule that calls it does. Ambit's export writes the
line for every condition and exclusion.

**Folding** (`le_residue_fold.pl`, on by default; request field `fold: false`
turns it off). Once the winner is chosen, a residue translated as a single
rule concluding exactly its sentence is folded into the rules that call it:
each condition line naming it (`and the counterparty meets condition c22`)
is replaced by the rule's conditions, a condition folded in twice is kept
once, the block is removed, and its text and source stay as a comment above
the caller (`% folded in from residue c22 (...)`). The rows then read as the
source did, and every condition sits under the caller's label. A residue
stays a rule of its own when folding could change an answer: several rules,
a fact or the placeholder, conditions that are alternatives (a top-level
`or`), a name used anywhere but a condition line (a scenario stating `acme
fails condition c1`, which the skeleton's constraint reads through the name),
no caller, or conditions that would capture one of the caller's variables.
Before folding, a scenario's statement of a residue's sentence about an
entity (`d2 meets condition c33`, a reviewer's reading the translator carried
over) becomes the facts the translation rests on, said of the entity
(`d2 has an eligible English company registration ...`), when the
translation is one rule whose conditions are instances of one-slot
templates. A denial — the opposite form read from the program's own
constraints (`it must not be true that a counterparty meets a condition and
the counterparty fails the condition`) — becomes `it is not the case that
<the condition>` (a negated scenario fact, language.md §3), when the rule
has one condition. The original line stays above as a comment, repeated
facts are kept once, and the residue then folds like any other.
The folded program is delivered only if it verifies with no more errors and
no worse tests than before; the program before folding is kept as
`unfolded.le`, and the ledger's Folded column says, per residue, where it
went or why it stayed. For a file: `swipl -g "use_module(le_residue_fold),
fold_residue_file('in.le', 'out.le'), halt."`.

**Regressions are about answers.** A skeleton test whose answers still hold
after the splice is not a regression, whatever its unknowns: translating a
residue replaces the unknown it was (`acme meets condition c1`) with the
unknowns its rules rest on. The rounds stop when no test fails on its answers. A translator that writes expectations
for a skeleton with residue can say so in the program itself: `q expects
answers [...] and any unknowns.` checks the answers only (language.md §12).
Ambit's export writes each signed determination that way.

**No regression is delivered.** When the repair rounds end with a skeleton
test still broken, the job puts back the placeholder of each residue to blame
before it delivers (`residue_guard/4`). For each broken test, the reasoner's
why-not (`le_why_not.pl`) names the unmet conditions of the routes that came
closest; a rule inside a residue block is that residue's translation. Every
other residue the same rows call, whose sentence then has no answer at all in
that scenario, goes back too, since the skeleton always answered it by
assuming it. The block keeps its placeholder with a comment (`% kept unknown:
its translation was put back (scenario ...)`), the ledger lists it as
reverted, and the job repeats until no test regresses (ten rounds at most: each round blames what the current failure shows, and a row may fail on several residues in turn).
Errors come first: a residue block holding an error goes back to its
placeholder (`(error <type>)`), and a line of the RESIDUE TEMPLATES region
holding one is dropped — the editor runs no query on a program with an
error. A test that no longer finishes has no route for why-not to name:
then the rows the skeleton answered with, in that scenario, are read from its
explanation, and their translated residues with alternatives (two rules, or
`either`/`or`) go back first — each doubles the answers — and the rest of
those rows' translations if that is not enough. A translation that negates an unknown (`negated_unknown`, an
error inside a residue block) is the usual cause. Tests:
lpsPlus `contract_assistant/testing/test_residue_mode.pl`.

## 5. The defects fixed before the readers (Appendix A of the report)

- **D1** — `either`/`any of`/`at least one of` in a plain body joined every
  `and` below it with `or`, so a nested `all of` became a disjunction. Each
  direct child is now one alternative with its own structure.
- **D2** — `it is not the case that ...` in a numbered item was read through
  the generic "is" form. It is now a negation, with the goal on the item's
  line or as sub-items.
- **D3** — an `; opposite:` form used as a condition: documented (§2 of
  `le_summary.md`) and diagnosed (`opposite_as_condition` instead of
  `undefined_predicate`).
- **D4** — `verify/1` failed on every `lps`-target document because the LPS
  parsing hooks were not loaded; `le_kbs` loads them, and `verify/1` also
  prints the LPS emitter's own diagnostics. Propositional LPS templates are no
  longer reported as unused.

## The disclaimer every twin carries

`migration_text/3` closes the opening comment of every program it writes with
a disclaimer: the program was written by a translator, is provided "as is",
without warranty of any kind, may be wrong, and is not professional advice.
The text is the `twin_disclaimer` row of `i18n/writer_words.csv`, in the
program's language, wrapped at 78 columns (`with_disclaimer/2`). A translator
therefore needs to do nothing to carry it, and rebuilding a twin keeps it.
