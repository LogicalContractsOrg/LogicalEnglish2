# Error reports and web analytics: Sentry and Cloudflare

*Kind: operations · Audience: developers, operators · Status: current (2026-09-16)*

The LE2 server can report errors to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) — its own
exceptions and those of the pages it serves — offer a small **Feedback**
form (Sentry's User Feedback), and load [Cloudflare Web
Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) on its pages.

**Both are off unless the server's environment configures them, and only the
deployed server's does** (fly secrets, §3). With no variable set, nothing is
loaded and nothing leaves the server or the browser: every page still asks
for `/telemetry.js`, which then answers a comment. That is how tests, local
development and any other deployment run.

The LPS2 server has the same, with its own Sentry project and Web Analytics
site (`/lps2/docs/dev/telemetry.md`, variables `LPS_…`).

## What is sent, and what is not

| | Sent | Not sent |
|---|---|---|
| Server → Sentry | the API operation's name (`answeringQuery`, `load`, …), the error's type and message (at most 1000 characters), the Prolog backtrace when the error carries one, environment, release | the program, the query, the scenario, any other field of the request, the user's name or IP |
| Browser → Sentry | uncaught errors of the page, with the SDK's default context (browser, URL) and `sendDefaultPii: false` | console output (a page may log a program), screenshots (the feedback form has none: it would show the program) |
| Feedback form → Sentry | the message typed, and a name and email **only if** the user types them | — |

A query that runs out of time (`answeringQuery`, 240 seconds) is not a server
fault: it is reported as a message at level *info*, "The query did not finish
within 240 seconds and was stopped.", tagged `operation: answeringQuery`, and
the editor is told so. A `time_limit_exceeded` *error* in Sentry is some other
operation exceeding its 300 seconds.
| Browser → Cloudflare Web Analytics | Cloudflare's beacon: page views (the page's path, referrer, country, browser and device class) and page-load performance | cookies, local storage, fingerprinting, the page's contents, clicks, programs typed in the editor |

Every page address Sentry reports — an error's, the feedback form's — loses
its fragment and every query parameter but `example`, `scenario`, `query`
and `lang` (`url_params/1`): an editor link can carry a whole program
(`?text=…`, `#lzp=…`). The Cloudflare beacon is Cloudflare's own script and
reads the page's address itself. Cloudflare's dashboard reports paths, and a
fragment (`#lzp=…`) never leaves the browser, but check *Top paths* after
the first deployment to confirm that no `?text=` query string is kept (see
§4).

One class of browser report is dropped before it is sent (`ignoreErrors` in
`telemetry.js`): "Object Not Found Matching Id:*N*, MethodName:update,
ParamCount:4". It is not this page's error. Outlook — and the Office link
scanner behind it — opens an address in a browser of its own and injects a
script into the page; when that script fails, the page is what reports it,
with no stack, from a window nobody was looking at. Nothing in this
repository can cause it or fix it.

A second class is dropped too: "Canceled: Canceled" from the code editor
(Monaco) in Safari. On every click and key press the editor gets a copy to
the clipboard ready, in case one follows, and cancels the one it got ready
before. Safari reports each cancelled copy as an error nobody handled.
Nothing is wrong, and copying still works.

An error message is written by the code that raised it, and a few Prolog
errors quote the term they were about (a type error names the value it
found); with 1000 characters at most, that is the one way a fragment of a
program could reach Sentry.

The server sends a report from a thread of its own, with a five-second
timeout; the same error at most once in ten minutes, and at most sixty
reports an hour. An unreachable Sentry never slows or fails a request.

## The variables

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `LE_SENTRY_DSN` | the Sentry project's DSN: turns Sentry on | off |
| `LE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | Sentry's *environment* | `production` |
| `LE_SENTRY_RELEASE` | Sentry's *release* | `le2@<git hash>` from `build_info.txt` (written by `buildPush.sh`) |
| `LE_CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` | the Web Analytics site's token: turns the beacon on | off |

The names start with `LE_` so that the LPS2 server, which loads parts of
Logical English into its own process, never reports into these projects.

## 1. The Sentry project

1. Sign in at <https://sentry.io> (or create the organisation).
2. **Projects ▸ Create Project**. Platform: **Browser JavaScript**. Alert
   frequency: *Alert me on every new issue*. Name: `logical-english-2`.
   Create it. (Skip the SDK instructions: the pages load the SDK
   themselves.)
3. Copy the **DSN**: *Settings ▸ Projects ▸ logical-english-2 ▸ Client Keys
   (DSN)*. It looks like `https://<key>@o<nnn>.ingest.<region>.sentry.io/<nnn>`.
   The one DSN serves both reporters: the browser SDK, and the server's
   Prolog reporter (`le_telemetry.pl`, which speaks Sentry's envelope
   protocol). Server events carry the tag `server: le2` and platform
   `other`; the browser's are JavaScript.
4. **Allowed domains**: *Settings ▸ Projects ▸ logical-english-2 ▸ General
   Settings ▸ Client Security ▸ Allowed Domains*: `le2.logicalcontracts.com`
   and `logicalenglish2.fly.dev` (every host the server is reached at). Events from other origins
   are then refused.
5. **Privacy**: *Settings ▸ Projects ▸ logical-english-2 ▸ Security &
   Privacy*: keep *Data Scrubber* on, and turn on *Prevent Storing of IP
   Addresses*.
6. **User Feedback** needs nothing to be enabled: the form is part of the
   pages' SDK bundle, and what users send appears under *User Feedback* in
   the sidebar (or *Issues ▸ Feedback*).
7. **Alerts**: the project comes with *new issue → email*. To be told of a
   burst too: *Alerts ▸ Create Alert ▸ Issues ▸ Number of events in an
   issue is more than 20 in one hour → Send a notification to the project's
   team*.

## 2. The Cloudflare Web Analytics site

The site already exists; its token is `TTT`.
To create it again, or check its settings:

1. Sign in at <https://dash.cloudflare.com> ▸ **Analytics & Logs ▸ Web
   Analytics** ▸ **Add a site**.
2. Hostname: `le2.logicalcontracts.com`, the public address (the site is not proxied by
   Cloudflare, so the JS snippet is the way in; no DNS change).
3. Cloudflare shows the snippet:

   ```html
   <!-- Cloudflare Web Analytics --><script type='module' src='https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js' data-cf-beacon='{"token": "TTT"}'></script><!-- End Cloudflare Web Analytics -->
   ```

   Do **not** paste it into the pages: only its token is needed. The server
   adds the same script to every page it serves (`telemetry.js`), and only
   when the token is set, so local runs and tests are never counted.
4. The token is not secret (it ends up in every page); it is kept as a fly
   secret so that only the deployed server has it.

## 3. Setting the variables on fly.io

The app is `logicalenglish2` (`fly.toml`). Neither value is secret — both end
up in every page — but as fly secrets they stay out of `fly.toml`, the image
and every other environment: only the deployed server reports.

```sh
fly secrets set -a logicalenglish2 \
    LE_SENTRY_DSN='https://<key>@o<nnn>.ingest.de.sentry.io/<nnn>' \
    LE_CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN='TTT'
fly secrets list -a logicalenglish2        # names and digests, to check
```

`fly secrets set` restarts the machine with the new values (add `--stage`
to apply them at the next `fly deploy` instead). To turn one off:
`fly secrets unset -a logicalenglish2 LE_CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`.

Do not set `LE_CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` locally: the local pages would be
counted as the site's. To try Sentry locally, export `LE_SENTRY_DSN` with
`LE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development`, so that local errors can be filtered
out.

## 4. Checking it works

- **Server**: open `https://logicalenglish2.fly.dev/telemetry_test`. It
  answers `{"sentry": true, "web_analytics": true, "sentry_test": "sent", …}` and
  sends a test error, `telemetry_test`, tagged `operation: telemetry_test`,
  `server: le2` — it appears in Sentry's *Issues* within a minute. (It is
  throttled like any report: again within ten minutes it says so and sends
  nothing, so the URL cannot flood the project.)
- **Browser errors**: open the editor, then in the browser's console
  `Sentry.captureException(new Error('browser check'))`.
- **Feedback**: the *Feedback* button, bottom right of every page; send a
  message and find it under *User Feedback*.
- **Web Analytics**: in the browser's developer tools (*Network*), a page
  loads `static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js` and posts to
  `cloudflareinsights.com/cdn-cgi/rum`. The dashboard (*Web Analytics ▸
  logicalenglish2.fly.dev*) shows the visits within minutes. In *Top paths*,
  check that the editor's `?text=…` links do not appear with their query
  string (the `#lzp=…` form of a link is not a path and is not reported).

The unit test `testing/test_telemetry.pl` checks the DSN parsing, the
envelope, the throttling and that nothing happens unconfigured, with a mock
Sentry on a local port.

## Cookies and consent

Cloudflare Web Analytics sets no cookie and uses no local storage, and Sentry
stores nothing on the device, so neither needs a consent banner under the
EU's ePrivacy rules. Turn on *Prevent Storing of IP Addresses* in Sentry
(step 1.5).

## Where the code is

- `le_telemetry.pl` — the configuration, the server's reports (Sentry
  envelope over HTTP), `/telemetry.js` and `/telemetry_test`.
- `web_extras/telemetry/telemetry.js` — the pages' client: loads Sentry's
  pinned CDN bundle (with its integrity hash) and Cloudflare's beacon.
  LPS2 has a copy (`src/edges/lps_telemetry.js`): change both.
- `classic_web_api.pl` — the two handlers, the report in `handle_leapi/1`,
  and the script in the server-rendered pages; the static pages
  (`editor/*.html`, `web_extras/*/index.html`) have
  `<script src="/telemetry.js">` in their head.
- The feedback form's words are rows of `i18n/ui.csv`, in the language of
  the `le_ui_lang` cookie.

If a Content Security Policy is ever added, it must allow
`browser.sentry-cdn.com` and `static.cloudflareinsights.com` (scripts), and
`*.ingest.sentry.io` and `cloudflareinsights.com` (connect).
