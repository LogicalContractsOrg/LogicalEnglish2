# Language features, one program each

Small programs, each showing one feature of Logical English, grouped by the
part of the [language reference](/docs/user/reference/language) they
illustrate. Open a folder's guide from its heading, or a program from the list.

## Start here

- [Functions](templates/functions.le?scenario=one_currency&query=expensive) — a value a sentence names, such as the price of a cup.
- [Unknowns](unknowns/unknowns.le?scenario=one&query=one) — answers that hold if something unknown turns out true.
- [Abduction](abduction/grass_is_wet.le?scenario=observation&query=explain) — explaining an observation by what it assumes.
- [Memoization](memoization/family_relatives.le?scenario=tudors&query=ancestors) — remembering answers so that a family tree is searched once.

## Try this

1. Open [functions](templates/functions.le?scenario=one_currency&query=expensive) and click **Query**: "mug is expensive".
2. Click the answer to see its explanation, step by step.
3. Open [unknowns](unknowns/unknowns.le?scenario=one&query=one) and click **Query**. Alice and bob both become rich, but alice only on a condition, shown in amber: that she knows 42 will win the lottery.
4. Open [memoization](memoization/family_relatives.le?scenario=tudors&query=ancestors) and click **Query**: the four ancestors of Lettice.
