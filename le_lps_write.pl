/** <module> LPS internal syntax back to Logical English

    `dump_le`: the direction lps2's docs/project/plan-of-record.md §I.9.5 asks for, and the reason
    it lives here rather than in LPS(2) — LE2 owns the template dictionary, so
    LE2 owns the only mapping that can be inverted. A template is what tells
    `played(miguel, rock)` from `beats(rock, scissors)`; without one there is
    nothing to write back *to*.

    ## What it is for

    §I.9.5 makes the round trip a TEST, not a feature. The claim it checks is:

	LE  ->  internal  ->  LE  ->  internal      the two internal forms are
						   variant/2-equal

    That is a real claim about the language — it says the internal form carries
    everything the English did, up to the choices this writer makes about
    wording and variable names — and it is checked by testing/lps_roundtrip.pl
    over LPS2's examples/le (seventeen; testing/lps_roundtrip.pl).

    It deliberately does NOT claim the two ENGLISH texts are equal. They are
    not, and could not be: `a first player` and `a player` are the same
    variable, `the reward is 0` and `the reward is 0 at time 1` are the same
    initial state, and a document's comments, section order and choice of
    synonym are not recoverable from the terms. Comparing the internal forms is
    the strongest claim that is actually true.

    ## How variables are named

    Every variable in a term gets an English name from the TYPE of the argument
    position it first appears in, taken from the template dictionary: the first
    variable of type `player` is `a player`, the second `a second player`, and
    every later occurrence is `the player` / `the second player`. Times are
    typed `time` by construction. A variable in no typed position is `a thing`.

    This is what makes the round trip meaningful rather than circular: the
    names are derived from the templates, not carried over from the source, so
    a program that survives has survived losing them.

    ## A program that never had a dictionary

    Everything above needs a dictionary, because a template is what tells
    `played(miguel, rock)` from `beats(rock, scissors)`. An LPS program
    written in the older Prolog-like syntax — a `.lps` file — has no
    dictionary and no Logical English original to take one from.
    `le_lps_from_internal/4` is the answer for that case: it reads the
    predicates out of the internal terms themselves, words a template for each
    one from the predicate's own name, binds the wording back to the name with
    `; known as`, and then writes the document the ordinary way. The wording is
    a guess about English and nothing else depends on it being a good guess:
    the binding, not the words, is what carries the meaning, which is why a
    converted program runs exactly as the original did.

%   The Logical English document an LPS program would have had, if it had
%   been written in Logical English. Terms are the LPS internal terms of
%   lps2's plan-of-record §I.3, as its readers give them for a `.lps`
%   program in the older Prolog-like syntax. Such a program has no template
%   dictionary and no Logical English original to take one from, so this
%   predicate makes one: a template for every predicate the program
%   mentions, worded from the predicate's own name (`pick_up(Who, What)` ->
%   `*a thing* picks up *a second thing*`) and bound back to that name with
%   `; known as`, which is what keeps the two programs the same program.
%
%   Options:
%
%     * kb(Name)        the knowledge base's name. Default `lps`.
%     * language(Lang)  the language to word the templates in. Default `en`.
%     * comment(Text)   a comment block written above the document.
%
%   Issues come back as issue(Severity, Code, Message) terms, never as
%   silence: a term with no Logical English form is written into the
%   document as a residue comment and reported here as well.
