Your residue translations were spliced into the skeleton and the whole program
was verified by the LE engine and run against its scenarios — which are the
source system's own tests. FEEDBACK lists what is still wrong. An item that begins
`residue <id>` belongs to that residue's block; other line numbers are lines
of THE PROGRAM AS SPLICED (given below — shortened, when it is long, to what
concerns the residues listed).

The residue ids are:

{{ids}}

Your current blocks:

Reply with a fenced block for EACH residue you change, in the same form
(```le residue <id>```), holding its complete new text. A block you do not send
keeps its current text. Never change the skeleton — you cannot; the fix is
always in a residue block (or in the `templates` block).

- `regression`: a scenario that passed with the residue untranslated fails
  with your translation — your rules conclude something they should not.
- `residue_conclusion`: your block does not conclude the sentence the residue
  names, or concludes it for everything (its constant replaced by `a ...`).
  Keep the constant; if the text gives nothing checkable, conclude it from a
  named unknown in the text's own words.
- `residue_open`: the block still holds only the skeleton's placeholder (or
  nothing): translate the text — a caveat or an assumption becomes a named
  unknown in the text's own words; keep the placeholder (with a comment
  saying why) only for text with no legal reading at all.
- `residue_restates`: the block only repeats what the rule calling it already
  checks. Write as conditions what the text adds, with new templates
  (`; unknown`) where needed.
- `negated_unknown`: `it is not the case that` over a template declared
  `; unknown` never holds. Phrase the requirement as its own template
  (`*a counterparty* is not in administration; unknown.`) and use it
  positively — for an exclusion, `*a counterparty* is not <the excluded
  class, in the text's words>; unknown.`
- `suspicious_is_a` / `suspicious_is`: a sentence read as a type (`X is a
  company registered ...`) or as a value, not as your template: reword the
  template so that it does not continue `is a` / `is an` after its slot.
- `unknown_template`: a sentence of yours matches no declared template.
- a failing expectation: compare the expected answer (the source system's) with
  what your rules computed, and correct the rules.
