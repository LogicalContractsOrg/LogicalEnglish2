% ── Memoization of `; memorable` templates ──────────────────────────────────
%
%   docs/user/reference/language.md §2.4. A program marks a template
%   `; memorable` when the same call on it is made many times in a query —
%   the repeated sub-proofs that the explanation's redundancy detection
%   (group_variant_whys/2, le_api:mark_cross_tree_repeats/2) finds after the
%   fact. The reasoner then does the work once: the FIRST call of each
%   distinct call (distinct up to variable renaming — a variant, not merely a
%   unifiable term) computes EVERY answer of the call, each with its
%   unknowns and its explanation, and the later variant calls of the same
%   query replay them. Only a completed call is replayed: while a call is
%   being computed (memo_active/2) a recursive variant of it inside the
%   computation is solved as usual, so that the loop check on the ancestor
%   list decides recursion exactly as it does without the marker.
%
%   The cache lives for ONE query (memo_enter/1 at i/4 and explain/4): a
%   session's facts change between queries (a scenario is set, a fact
%   asserted, a flip query tries changes), and an entry computed under other
%   facts would be a wrong answer with a confident explanation. Within a
%   query each nested proof — a why-not attempt, a section check, a flip,
%   the constraint checks of consistent_assumptions/4 — gets a generation of
%   its own (with_saved_reasoner_state/1), and entries of other generations
%   are never consulted: those proofs run under other assumptions or other
%   facts. A scoped proof (`according to`, §17.5) is part of the key.
%
%   Answers are indexed by the hash of the call (variant_sha1/2 on a copy
%   without attributes), one clause per answer (memo_answer/6), so a replay
%   copies one answer at a time; the type constraints the answer's free
%   variables carried (when/2 goals) are stored beside it and re-attached.
%   memo_alias/2 lets a replayed call's failure explanation — and the
%   exhausted alternatives of a replayed choice point — be read from the
%   records of the call that did the work (failure_children/2).
%
%   Not memoized: a call made while a variant of it is still active (above),
%   a call whose computation met the loop check on one of the call's own
%   ancestors (its answers are those of that place only: note_loop_cut/1),
%   and every literal of a template without the marker. The verifier warns
%   about a memorable call under a negation (a negation stops at the first
%   answer, the memorable call computes them all) and about a memorable
%   predicate whose rules run an embedded `prolog` goal (which could change
%   state under the cached answers).

%   "*a date* is *a number* months after *an other date*" — calendar months,
%   as statutes and policies count them ("within six months", "36 months"),
%   which days cannot express: six months after 28 August is 28 February, 184
%   days later. With Before (or Later) and Count given, the other date is
%   computed, the day of the month kept where the month has it and otherwise
%   the month's last day (31 August + 6 months = 28 February). With both dates
%   given, Count is the number of WHOLE months from Before to Later (negative
%   when Later is earlier): 28 February is 6 months after 28 August, 27
%   February only 5. So a deadline reads "a limit is 6 months after the date
%   and the other date is before or equal to the limit".
