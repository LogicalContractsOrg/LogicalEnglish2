/** <module> The LE language service — one module for an embedder to load

    LPS2 no longer talks to Logical English over HTTP or through a subprocess:
    it loads *this* module into its own SWI-Prolog image and calls predicates.
    This file is the documented surface of that arrangement, so an embedder
    never reaches into le_kbs or le_grammar and those two stay free to move.
    The plan is docs/project/plans/LEintegrationImprovementPlan.md in the LPS2 repository,
    items R1 (this module), R2 (lifecycle and containment) and R3 (the
    editor-facing data).

    Nothing here parses, emits or renders anything itself. Parsing is
    le_grammar's, the LE->LPS emitter is le_lps's, the lexicon is le_i18n's
    and the CSV dictionaries under i18n/ are its single source; this module
    selects, shapes and hands over.

    ## What an embedder gets

      1. **The payload** — le_lps_text/4, le_lps_file/4, le_lps_module/5,
         le_lps_dict/4, le_lps_json/1, le_lps_json_text/1, re-exported from
         le_lps unchanged. This is the §2 object of lps2's docs/dev/le-lps-interface.md
         and it does not change shape because it is now reached differently.
      2. **Lifecycle and containment** — le_kb_of_text/3, le_kb_dispose/1,
         and the network switch re-exported from le_kbs.
      3. **The editor-facing data** — le_lexicon/2, le_languages/1,
         le_templates/3, le_blocks/3, le_analyse/3, and the `*_dict`
         variants of those that an HTTP or JSON layer can serialise directly.

    ## Why loading this in another process is safe

    Loading a Logical English document parses and asserts; it does not run the
    document. le_kbs:load_prolog_resource/4 is assert-only — it honours
    dynamic/1, discontiguous/1 and use_module(library(Lib)) for atomic library
    names, strips module/2 with a warning, and skips initialization/1 and
    every other directive, precisely so that a fetched .pl cannot execute at
    load time. Runtime `prolog` bodies pass library(sandbox)'s safe_goal/1 in
    the reasoner. The one thing a document *can* still reach for on its own is
    the network, when a resource is given as a URL — which is what
    set_le_network_allowed/1 is for.

    ## The two things to know about KB modules

    le_kbs:load_text/2 is content-addressed: the module for a document is
    `m<sha1 of its text>`, and an error-free module is reused rather than
    reparsed. So compiling the same buffer twice is nearly free, and an editor
    should NOT dispose after every compile — it would throw that cache away on
    every keystroke. Dispose when a document is closed.

    le_kb_dispose/1 reclaims only what is safe to reclaim: le_kbs's own
    liveness check refuses to abolish a module a session or another reader
    still references. Calling it on a live KB is a no-op, not a corruption.

    ## Concurrency

    Safe to call from several threads at once, which is what an embedder
    serving HTTP needs to know. The three pieces of state that would have made
    it unsafe are already per-thread or already locked: le_i18n keeps the
    active language in a global variable, which in SWI is thread-local;
    le_kbs's le_include_base/1 is declared thread_local; and load_text/2 takes
    a per-module mutex. A Portuguese document analysed on one thread while an
    English one is analysed on another gives the same answers as either alone
    — which is a test, not an inference, and it is why an embedder does not
    need a mutex of its own around these calls.

    ## What is deliberately not here

    A route to the reasoner. An embedder that wants answers to queries wants
    le_kbs, and should say so; this module exists for the two jobs an editor
    has — turning a document into a program, and knowing enough about the
    language to highlight and complete it.

    The four declaration sections (`the fluents are:` and its siblings) do not
    record their own start and end offsets — le_grammar keeps offsets on each
    template, not on the section around it — so le_blocks/3 reports the
    sections that do (knowledge bases, scenarios, queries, the ontology) and
    each template individually. Aggregating a section extent from its
    templates would be a guess, and a guess is worse than an absence.

%       analysis(Language, Target, Templates, Blocks, Issues)
%
%   `Language` is the program's own language, detected from its opener;
%   `Target` its target language (`lps`, `prolog`, `scasp`); Templates and
%   Blocks are le_templates/3 and le_blocks/3; Issues are the LE-side
%   diagnostics, as `le_issue(Severity, Type, Message, Fix, Line, Col)` with
%   positions already resolved.
%
%   This always answers. A document LE can load but disagrees with comes back
%   with whatever it did understand and its own diagnostics — a malformed
%   section is an `unknown_section` issue, not a refusal. Only a document that
%   cannot be loaded at all falls back to no templates, no blocks and a single
%   `parse_error`. An editor must never be left with nothing to show.
%
%   Options are le_kb_of_text/3's, plus:
%
%     * dispose(Bool)
%     Reclaim the KB module before returning. Default false: the module is
%     the parse cache, and an editor that disposes here reparses on every
