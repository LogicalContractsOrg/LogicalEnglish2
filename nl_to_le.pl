/** <module> Natural-language → Logical English conversion (LLM-assisted, verified).

    Turns an English sentence into Logical English (LE) text — either fact statements
    (for a scenario) or a query body — that respects the templates already declared in
    a program, and then VERIFIES the result against that program before returning it.

    This is the "Write it in English…" path of the Scenario and Query editors: one
    interactive conversion, seconds not minutes, against a program the user owns and
    which is never modified. Its bigger sibling is the LE Contract Assistant, which
    generates whole programs (and, in its `scenario` / `query` modes, fragments) as a
    budgeted background job; the two share the verifier and the way verifier issues are
    ranked and presented to a model (le_issue_feedback.pl), and nothing else.

    The loop:

      1. Verify the baseline Program as given, to record its PRE-EXISTING issues (and
         which of its tests pass — a fragment must not break one).
      2. Ask the LLM for an initial fragment (facts / query body) from the sentence.
      3. Splice the fragment into a throw-away copy of the program (as a scenario or a
         query block) and verify that. Compare to the baseline: only issues that are
         NOT in the baseline count as NEW — they were introduced by the fragment. Their
         line numbers are re-based onto the fragment, since that is all the model sees.
      4. If there are new issues, feed back a RANKED, capped working set of them —
         errors first, then warnings that change what the program means, then cosmetic
         ones — and re-verify. This repeats while the rounds keep improving, bounded by
         a patience counter and a hard round cap (see refine/12).
      5. Keep the BEST round, not the last one: a correction can make things worse, and
         it used to be the worse version that was returned.
      6. Return the final fragment plus any new issues that still remain. The spliced
         program is discarded — only the fragment (the new scenario facts or query) is
         kept; the caller may warn about, yet still use, a fragment with new issues.

    The single entry point is english_to_le/8. The Model id and Options are passed
    straight to the LLM client (llm/le_llm.pl chooses which); if Options omits
    api_key(_), the provider env var (e.g. GROQ_API_KEY) is used. Options may also
    carry this module's own `max_rounds(N)` and `patience(N)`, which are consumed here
    rather than forwarded. Verification uses le_verifier:verify/2 in-process.

%   @arg Sentence  the English text (atom or string) to translate.
%   @arg Templates a list of template label strings/atoms WITH their `*...*` markers;
%                  the model must produce only instances of these.
%   @arg Program   the baseline LE program source (atom/string): its templates and
%                  rules give the verification context, and its existing scenarios and
%                  queries are shown to the model as the house style to match. The
%                  fragment is spliced into a COPY of it for checking; Program itself
%                  is never modified.

%                  `max_rounds(N)` and `patience(N)` bound the refinement loop,
%                  and `check_regressions(true)` additionally runs the program's
%                  own tests before and after the splice (off by default — see
%                  baseline/3).
%   @arg LEText    the cleaned LE fragment (a string): facts (kind facts) or a query
%                  body (kind query), fences/prose stripped.
%   @arg NewIssues the issues introduced by LEText that are NOT in the baseline and
%                  still remain after refinement, most important first (errors, then
%                  warnings about meaning, then cosmetic ones). Each is a dict with

%               working programs carry a warning or two, and reporting those back as
%               "problems with your sentence" is what made the old warning list noise);
%     - lines:  how many lines the program has, so a spliced issue's line number can be
%               re-based onto the fragment the model actually wrote;
%     - loaded: whether the program parsed at all. When it did not, a fragment cannot be
%               blamed for the wreckage, so the load-failure issue is suppressed rather
%               than shown to a user who asked about one sentence;

- Never begin a value with 'a', 'an' or 'the': write 'United Kingdom', not 'the United Kingdom'.\n\
- Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD, and numbers without thousands separators or currency symbols (18500, not £18,500).\n\
- Do not state anything the sentence does not: no outcomes, no conclusions the rules are supposed to derive (never a fact of a template marked (derived)), no invented identifiers beyond what is needed to name the individuals the sentence talks about.\n\
- What the sentence DENIES is not written at all ('the child is not adopted', 'he has no convictions'): a fact that is not stated is false. Never write the fact the sentence denies."
