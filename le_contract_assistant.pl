/** <module> LE Contract Assistant

    Converts a contract — normative wording + schedule of parameters + concrete
    cases (e.g. an insurance policy + policy schedule + claims) — into a tested
    Logical English knowledge base, as described in
    docs/dev/contract-assistant.md.

    THREE JOBS, one apparatus. The request's `mode` field selects which:

      - `contract` (the default, and the pipeline described below): materials
        in, a whole tested program out.
      - `scenario`: an English description of a situation, plus a Logical
        English program the user already has and which is NEVER modified, in;
        ONE `scenario ... is:` block out.
      - `query`: the same, for a question; ONE `query ... is:` block out.

    The fragment modes run fragment_stages/1 — see the section it heads for why
    each surviving part of the apparatus still earns its place at that size, and
    what is dropped. They exist because everything below (verify, rank the
    issues by how much they change the meaning, repair, keep the best, say what
    is NOT covered) is worth having for one scenario too. The Scenario Editor's
    own one-shot conversion (nl_to_le.pl) is deliberately a different thing: one
    call and a few seconds, no background job, always available; these modes are
    the budgeted version, for when the block matters.

    Pipeline for `contract` mode (per that plan):
      0. ingest & segment      — uploads to text (pandoc/textutil/pdftotext for
                                 Word/PDF), markdown segmentation, target slice;
                                 held-out split of the cases (feature `holdout`)
      1. vocabulary consensus  — K template-inventory samples merged by a judge,
         + architectures         then W alternative architecture sketches
      2-4. draft (per branch)  — full LE draft (or clause-by-clause with a live
                                 ledger, feature `clausewise`): rules + schedule
                                 facts + case scenarios with expectations
      5. repair (per branch)   — verify/test loop; SEARCH/REPLACE diff edits
                                 with full-program fallback (feature
                                 `diff_repairs`); keeps the best iteration
      5a. polish (per branch)  — once the program loads clean, bounded rounds
                                 (feature `polish`) that remove WARNINGS — dead
                                 templates, rules no query reaches — accepted
                                 only when no test is lost
      5b. held-out evaluation  — blind scenarios for the held-out cases, scored
                                 above development tests in the fitness rank
      6. select & interrogate  — objective fitness; differential interrogation
                                 probes (feature `probes`) with adjudication
                                 repairs; paraphrase-invariance check (feature
                                 `paraphrase`); ledger for the winner

    The search is scaled by the user's budget preset (draft / standard /
    thorough); every feature is individually switchable through the request's
    `features` dict (see features_params/3).

    Two other things the user controls: ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS (free text
    carried into every drafting/repair prompt, overriding the house defaults)
    and the TARGET, which is either a section title (that section and its
    subsections, plus the general terms) or a range — `from A until B`, with an
    optional `(inclusive)` — for the ill-formed markdown that policy wordings
    are made of. Scenarios are never invented: exactly the supplied cases, plus
    whatever the existing code brought, unless the instructions ask for more.

    The user may supply EXISTING LE CODE (templates, scenarios with expected
    answers, rules — any combination): a fragment the generated program must
    contain and stay coherent with, so the twin aligns with a program the user
    has already started. It is injected into every drafting/repair prompt and
    its survival in the delivered program is checked and reported.

    Jobs run in a background thread; progress is polled through the /leapi
    operations contract_start / contract_status / contract_result /
    contract_interrupt (see classic_web_api.pl), same conventions as the LE
    Assistant; contract_cost_estimate prices a configuration before it runs
    (prices from llm/llm_prices.pl). The web UI lives in
    web_extras/contract_assistant/.

    For tests, the LLM can be stubbed by asserting ca_llm_hook/1 with a closure
    called as call(Closure, Purpose, Messages, ReplyText), and jobs can be run
    synchronously with start_contract_job/3 option sync(true). One level lower,
    ca_raw_hook/1 (called as call(Closure, Model, Messages, Options, Reply))
    replaces the provider call itself, to exercise the retry/auto-tuning
    ladder of llm_outcome/9.

% ==================== Fragment modes: scenario / query =======================
%
% Same apparatus, much smaller target. The user has a Logical English program
% they consider correct, and a paragraph of English: a situation to turn into
% ONE scenario, or a question to turn into ONE query. The program is an input
% and never an output — no template is added, no rule is touched — so everything
% the whole-contract pipeline does to a program is done here to the BLOCK, with
% the program supplying the vocabulary and the verification context.
%
% What carries over, and why each part still earns its place at this size:
%
%   - VERIFY THE SPLICE, REPORT THE DIFFERENCE. The block is appended to a
%     throw-away copy of the program and the whole thing is verified; issues the
%     program already had are subtracted, and line numbers are re-based onto the
%     block, which is all the model ever sees (verify_fragment/3).
%   - RANKED, CAPPED FEEDBACK, best-iteration-kept repair rounds: the same
%     repair_loop discipline, because the failure modes are the same ones —
%     a fact that quietly holds of everyone, a sentence that matches no template.
%   - REGRESSION IS AN ERROR. The program is unchangeable, so a block that makes
%     one of its passing tests fail is not a trade-off to weigh: it is wrong.
%   - EXERCISE. A new scenario is run against every query the program has, and a
%     new query against every scenario, and the answers are reported. A scenario
%     no query can say anything about, or a query that answers nothing anywhere,
%     is the commonest way for a fragment to be perfectly valid and useless.
%   - A COVERAGE COMMENT, as the whole-contract runs get a coverage ledger: what
%     of the supplied text the block does NOT represent, as `%` lines prepended
%     to the block itself, so the limitation travels with the code.
%
% What does not carry over: vocabulary consensus and architecture sketches (the
% vocabulary is given and there is nothing to decompose), the held-out split,
% interrogation probes and the paraphrase check.

% ======================= Residue mode: a fixed skeleton =======================
%
% The migration pipelines (le_writer.pl, le_migration.pl; InsurLE2/docs/
% InsurLE2/docs/migration/roadmap.md §4.4) translate everything structural
% deterministically and leave what has no deterministic reading — a rating
% plugin, a Gosu method body, a helper function — as RESIDUE: a block in the
% program, between two marker lines, holding the source fragment as comments:
%
%     % RESIDUE r3 BEGIN: the collision rating plugin
%     %   source: plugins/rating.js lines 40-61
%     %   javascript:
%     %   | if (vehicle.age > 10) { premium = premium * 1.2; }
%     % RESIDUE r3 END
%
% This mode fills in those blocks and nothing else. The skeleton — every line
% outside the blocks — is FIXED: the reply is not a program but one LE block
% per residue, which the job splices between the markers itself, so no reply
% can touch the deterministic part, by construction. An optional
% `% RESIDUE TEMPLATES BEGIN` / `END` region (in the templates section) is where
% the templates a residue needs may be declared.
%
% The fitness function is the one of every other mode — verify, then the
% program's own scenarios, which in a migration are the SOURCE's tests turned
% into expectations (le_migration.pl) — with one addition from the fragment
% modes: a test of the skeleton that passed before and fails after is an
% error (`regression`), since the skeleton is right by construction.

%   it is a fresh draft that happens to be prompted with the old one, and it
%   throws away everything that already works. Observed in one run: a branch
%   went 82 → 36 → **1** error, and the next reply — a full program again —
%   put it back to 77, then 21, then 18, and the four remaining rounds went on
%   patching that instead of the version that was one error from clean.
%
%   So while the program is close (at most `max_rewrite_errors`, 5 by default)
%   a rewrite has to EARN its place: `guarded(V)` carries the current
%   verification, and a whole new program is accepted only if it verifies
%   strictly better than the one it would replace (rewrite_accepted/4).
%
%   A guard rather than a refusal on purpose. A flat "edits only" rule
%   deadlocks the loop for a model that cannot produce SEARCH/REPLACE blocks at
%   all: every reply refused, no progress, patience spent on identical rounds.
%   With the feature off the full program IS the repair mechanism, so the policy
%   is `any` and nothing changes.

% out of the same reading:
%
%   - records of the SAME case spread over several files (claims.json and
%     expected_outcomes.json, both keyed by "claimRef") are merged into one
%     case, so the expected outcome travels with the claim it belongs to;
%   - a case that NAMES a schedule (its "policyRef" is the key of an entry in
%     schedules.json) carries that entry with it: the limits, deductibles and
%     elections that decide the claim are per policy, so they belong in that
%     claim's scenario rather than in one global set of facts.
