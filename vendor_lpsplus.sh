# signing in and who holds which licence), migration/ (the translators of
# other systems that File ▸ Open and Export offer) and contract_assistant/
# (the LE Contract Assistant: its module, prompts, web page and tests). Only the files git knows
# about or would add: the gitignored caches of fetched sources and tools
# (gigabytes of them) stay behind.
#
# vendor/lpsplus/ is gitignored: it is a copy of a PRIVATE repository, with
# the licences and passwords tables in it. It must never be committed here,
# and the WebAssembly build never packs it (wasm/pack.pl).
