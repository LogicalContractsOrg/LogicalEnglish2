/** <module> What goes into a WebAssembly build, and what must not

    The browser build carries its own file system: the examples, the i18n
    dictionaries, the shared LE libraries and LE2's own Prolog, unpacked into
    the virtual file system of the worker before the first request. This file
    decides what that is — and, more to the point, what it is not.

    **The rule.** A file goes in only if an anonymous visitor to the server
    deployment could already read it. That is not a judgement made here: it is
    restricted_paths.pl's `is_path_allowed(Path, [])`, the same call the /leapi
    operations make for a request with no session. The WASM build has no
    accounts and cannot have any — it is a static site, and every byte it
    ships is a byte the visitor has — so anything a server would have asked a
    user to log in for is not shippable, and is left out.

    On top of that rule, three exclusions of its own:

      * **symbolic links.** `le_extensions.pl`, `le_importers.pl` and the
        `insureLE2`/`lpsPlus` example trees are links into private sibling
        repositories. A link resolves perfectly well on the machine that
        builds, which is exactly what makes it dangerous: the proprietary
        grammar extensions would be published by accident. Links are skipped,
        and `--private` is the one way to include them, for a deployment that
        is not public.
      * **anything with an account in it**: `vendor/` (the copy of lpsPlus
        that vendor_lpsplus.sh makes for the server's image holds the
        licences and passwords tables), and the old `le_users.db`.
      * **the large public trees** of light_excluded/1 (the customs and
        Medicare models, the OIPA twins): the browser build is "LE light",
        and a visitor should not unpack 12 MB before the first request.

    `payload_files(-Files)` is the list, relative to the repository root, in
    the order they should be unpacked. build.sh asks for it and hands it to
    the packer; nothing else decides what ships.
