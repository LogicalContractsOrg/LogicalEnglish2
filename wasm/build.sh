# the pages (the editor, the Proof Game, the views, the documentation), the
# SWI-Prolog WebAssembly runtime, and one payload file holding LE2's Prolog,
# the dictionaries, the libraries and the examples. There is no server in it.
# Deploy it to Vercel with
#
#     cd wasm/dist && vercel deploy --prod
#
# or serve it from anywhere else that serves files (docs/dev/deploy-vercel.md).
#
# The fly.io deployment is untouched by any of this: the Dockerfile, fly.toml
# and buildPush.sh are the same as they were, and the only Prolog this build
# needs that the server does not is wasm/ itself.
