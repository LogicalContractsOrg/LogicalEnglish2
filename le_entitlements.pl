/** <module> What the current request may use: the licensed parts of an installation

    Two parts of an installation are licensed rather than free, and neither
    lives in this repository:

      - `converters`, `contract_assistant` and `extended_examples` — the
        translators of other systems (lpsPlus's `migration/le_importers.pl`),
        the LE Contract Assistant (this repository's le_contract_assistant.pl,
        gated in le_api.pl and classic_web_api.pl) and the private example
        trees, sold together as the licence "Logical English Translators"
        (`with_extensions` in the licences table);
      - `le_extensions` — InsurLE2's `le_extensions.pl`, the extra grammar
        (`which` clauses, `unless` bodies, grouped and numbered bodies, ...),
        sold as the licence "InsurLE".

    Which licences exist, who holds them and until when is decided in the
    lpsPlus repository (`accounts/lc_accounts.pl`, `accounts/licenses.csv`).
    This module only carries the answer for the request being served, so
    that the code which *uses* a licensed part can ask one question —
    entitled/1 — without knowing about accounts, cookies or servers.

    The answer is per thread: a server sets it at the start of every request
    (set_request_entitlements/1, from an HTTP request expansion), and a
    thread that no request has set gets the process default:

      - `all` — everything installed may be used. The default, and right for
        the command line, the test suites and a developer's machine.
      - `none` — nothing licensed may be used. What a server switches to when
        it starts (set_default_entitlements/1), so that a thread it creates
        for some other purpose cannot use what the visitor did not buy.

    `NO_RESTRICTIONS=true` in the environment lifts every restriction, as it
    does for restricted_paths.pl.
