/** <module> LPS backend for Logical English 2

    A third execution target, sibling to the Prolog and s(CASP) backends. It
    turns a Logical English document that declares

        the target language is: lps.

    into an LPS *internal-syntax* program — the frozen 2016 vocabulary of
    reactive_rule/2, l_int/2, l_events/2, initiated/3, terminated/3, updated/4,
    d_pre/1, initial_state/1 and observe/2 — together with a provenance list
    that points each generated term back at the `.le` sentence it came from.

    The contract with LPS(2) is lps2's docs/dev/le-lps-interface.md. The surface
    language is lps2's docs/user/reference/le-for-lps.md. Neither
    is restated here; what follows is how this module is built.

    ## Three stages, and why they are separate

    **Parsing** is le_grammar's, unchanged. The LPS sentence forms (`when …
    then …`, `it must not be true that …`, `initially …`) are extra kb_item
    clauses gated on the declared target, and each captures its antecedent and
    consequent as raw token lists. Nothing is interpreted there.

    **The second pass** is this module's, through le_grammar's multifile hooks:

      parse_node_extension/6      the temporal suffixes — `… at T`,
                                  `… from T1 to T2`, `… to T` — and the two
                                  consequent forms that are not literals,
                                  `initiate …` and `… becomes …`
      second_pass_item_extension/4 the LPS sentence forms

    It still interprets nothing about LPS. A condition comes out as
    `lps_at(Goal, T)`, which says only "this goal, at that time". Whether the
    goal is a fluent (so `holds/2`) or an event (so `happens/3`) is not decided
    here, because at second-pass time the declaration sections have not been
    processed yet.

    **The emitter** runs after load, over the KB module, exactly as
    le_scasp.pl does. By then `le_lps_role/2` records which declaration section
    each predicate came from, and that is what settles holds/2 versus
    happens/3. Doing it in one earlier pass would mean either ordering
    constraints on the document (declarations strictly before rules) or a
    second traversal; this way there are neither.

    ## What decides what

      - A literal's ROLE (fluent | event | action | prolog_event | timeless)
        comes from the section its template was declared in, never from how it
        is used. That is the distinction LPS cannot infer and the author must
        state.
      - `when` versus `if` decides causal law versus reactive rule. A `when`
        needs exactly one event or action in its antecedent — the trigger.
      - A temporal suffix is recognised by the HEAD NOUN of its variable being
        `time`. That is what tells `from a first place to a second place`
        (part of a template) from `from a first time to a second time` (a
        temporal annotation), and it is why the two can appear in the same
        sentence, as they do all through goat.le.

%
%   The same program with its fluent defaults (`defaults/1`) made explicit,
%   for a reader that has none — upstream LPS, or the legal view
%   (le_lps_legal.pl), whose state is a scenario of stated facts: every
%   read of a defaulted fluent in a constraint or a law's conditions becomes
%   two variants, the entry stored (its value) or absent (the default in its
%   place), and every update of one is preceded by a law that stores the
%   default when the entry is absent. That is the shape the Solidity
%   translator wrote before defaults existed (E13); defaults/1 is dropped.
