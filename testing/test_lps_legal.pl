/** <module> The legal view of an LPS program (le_lps_legal.pl)

    An LE-for-LPS program's integrity constraints become one permission rule
    per action, its causal laws effect rules, its fluents scenario elements —
    an ordinary Prolog-target LE program whose queries run in the editor. The
    wording is the program's own (English morphology for a template that
    starts with its actor and a verb; fixed words otherwise); a constraint on
    two actions at once and an action nothing governs are said, not turned
    into permissions. Also the /leapi operation `legalView`.

    Run with:  swipl -q -g run_tests -t halt testing/test_lps_legal.pl

bank("the target language is: lps.

the maximum time is 4.

the actions are:
    *a sender* transfers *an amount* to *a recipient*; known as transfer.
    *a pauser* halts the bank; known as halt.
    *a caller* calls audit; known as audit.

the fluents are:
    the balance of *an account* is *an amount*; known as balance.
    the bank is halted; known as halted.
    the pauser of the bank is *an account*; known as pauser.

the knowledge base bank includes:

initially the balance of alice is 100.
initially the pauser of the bank is carol.

it must not be true that
    a sender transfers an amount to a recipient from a time to a second time
    and the balance of the sender is a second amount at a time
    and the second amount < the amount.

it must not be true that
    a sender transfers an amount to a recipient from a time to a second time
    and the bank is halted at a time.

it must not be true that
    a sender transfers an amount to a recipient from a time to a second time
    and the sender transfers a second amount to a second recipient from the time to the second time
    and the recipient is different from the second recipient.

it must not be true that
    a pauser halts the bank from a time to a second time
    and the pauser of the bank is an account at a time
    and the account is different from the pauser.

it must not be true that
    a pauser halts the bank from a time to a second time
    and it is not the case that the pauser of the bank is an account at a time.

when a sender transfers an amount to a recipient from a time to a second time
    and the balance of the recipient is a second amount at a time
then the balance of the recipient that is a third amount becomes third amount + amount.

when a sender transfers an amount to a recipient from a time to a second time
    and the balance of the sender is a second amount at a time
then the balance of the sender that is a third amount becomes third amount - amount.

when a pauser halts the bank from a time to a second time
then initiate the bank is halted.

scenario one is:
    alice transfers 30 to bob from 1 to 2.
    carol halts the bank from 2 to 3.
