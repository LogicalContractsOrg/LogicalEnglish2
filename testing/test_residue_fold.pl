/** <module> Folding translated residue into the rules that call it

    le_residue_fold.pl: each condition line naming a translated residue is
    replaced by the translation's conditions, a condition folded in twice is
    kept once, and a residue whose folding could change an answer stays a
    rule of its own. Also the provenance labels the splice gives a residue's
    rules (le_contract_assistant:residue_label_rules/4).
