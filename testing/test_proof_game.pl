/** <module> Unit tests for the Proof Game's rule rendering (le_proof_game.pl).

    Pins down that a rule's explicit source variable identifiers (e.g. X) are
    shown in the game's rule nodes, and that coreferent occurrences of the same
    variable share a single id (so the game can link them). Uses the bundled
    examples/moreExamples/alice.le, whose rule

        Alice is happy if
            Alice likes a thing X
            and X likes Alice.

    must render the body condition as "Alice likes a thing X" (not "a thing").

    Run with:  swipl -g run_tests -t halt testing/test_proof_game.pl
    (or via testing/run_tests.sh unit)
