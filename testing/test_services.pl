/** <module> Services: call once, cache, attribute (semantic predicates over text)

    LE_extensions_proposal §3.6 and §4.1, docs/user/reference/language.md §17.6. Covers
    canonicalisation, the session cache, the persistent cache (hit, version
    refusal, warm cache with the service down), the HTTP backend against a
    live stub server, attribution in explanations and scoped proofs,
    materialise, the built-in semantic templates and the verifier.
